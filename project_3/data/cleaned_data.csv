We had a chat with **Ryan Nystrom (Director of Engineering at Github)** about Github’s feedback culture. In this interview, Ryan shares some **insider stories, tips** on how can you build a similar feedback culture.

**I’m highlighting my favourite tips here:**

0. Before anything else, you have to know, even if you’re at a small company, you can’t start it early enough. You need to set up a feedback system with a regular cycle. 

1. Have everyone do self-reviews

Wherever you are, it can’t hurt to think about what you’ve been doing over the last months. A bit of self-reflection is a great first stage for your feedback system. 

2. You need peer reviews

In the next step have your employees write peer reviews for each other. You want at least 3-5 peer reviews for everyone, but it never hurts to have more. 

3. Send feedback through the manager

Ryan’s recommendation for smaller companies’ feedback cycles is to send peer reviews through the managers. They compile it, and discuss it with team members individually.

There is a university near me that I can go to instead, but I’m not sure which would be the best option because I am open to both. If I were fresh out of high school I would absolutely just jump towards going to the university, however I have been on a completely different degree track (nursing) since I’ve graduated hs, and I have already acquired student loans and would rather not add any more if I don’t need to.

I’ve been looking at indeed at different software engineering jobs in my area to get a feel of what is required, and many of them say they require a bachelors degree + experience (I am in the STL area but in IL).

So my question is, is it even worth it to get an associates degree in the subject? Or just go straight with the bachelors? Is it harder to get a job with an associates degree or does it just pay less? I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense, but really any help or advice would be awesome.

I'm honestly wishing I had chosen to study CS, as I love data analysis and problem-solving. I've taught myself some python so far, which I've enjoyed and taken onto nicely, and feel this realization has come too late.

My college major is Earth and Environmental Sciences. I've really enjoyed the coursework which has involved a lot of analyzing and interpreting data(only through excel, however). I feel the Bootcamp would be a nice fit to fill in my gaps in coding and programming literacy. I'm unsure of if I'll be able to procure a decent job straight after graduating(especially with the current situation), which would provide the perfect opportunity to do a boot camp. The lifestyle of a programmer/software engineer fits me very well, especially with the widespread possibilities for remote work. 

**My question is:** Does anyone have any insight into the work prospects of those who do a Bootcamp following college graduation, compared with people who studied CS? 

Additionally, is internship experience in the field generally required to procure a position? I have work experience, but not in anything computer-related.

I had a full-time job offer which had the start date pushed back several months due to COVID. This would have been my first FTE job after graduating. However, in order to pay the bills in the interim, I accepted a full-time contract role (would have been FTE but the company froze hiring during my interview process, again due to COVID). I took the contract work with the understanding that my team intends to hire me full time once hiring unfreezes. My boss/ team seem to like me and be serious about hiring me as a FTE, but I am not certain when/if that will happen.

My issue is, in a few months I'm supposed to start working the original FTE job, but now I'm not sure I shouldn't just stay at my current position. The job I would be switching to is at a company I think looks better on a resume, and the work is more in line with what I want to pursue. The downside, is that this position is in the Bay, and pays less than my contract role (about $15k less accounting for taxes) but it would come with medical/dental/401k/etc. benefits, which my contract role does not.

I was able to negotiate about 9 months of remote work at the full-time role, but after that I'll be expected to move there, which in seriousness I don't want to do at all. So in that time, I would be doing everything possible to find a better role in my current state, or if things work out with the company I contract with, convert to FTE there. Between these two roles, what do you all think is a better bet for my future prospects? Effectively, I'd have a ~9 month window to search for jobs if I take the FTE job before being expected to move. My contract would be expiring at a similar time, assuming they don't unfreeze hiring, so the time I'd have to search is similar regardless."

I am building the initial set of unit tests for my team's legacy API client system. We have been writing integration tests, but have no unit tests.
It's a `Sinatra` server that accepts requests from our web app and contacts the third-party APIs. Sometimes it returns the result to the web app.

```
                                 1                     2
(Web app) ---&gt; Server endpoints ---&gt; API Client class ---&gt; 3rd party API

                                                        3
```

This being a legacy system, I am thinking about writing [characterization tests][1]. I will test the following:

1. mock our API Client class methods, to check how the input data to the server endpoints gets processed and formatted when it reaches our API Client class methods.
2. Similarly mock (or inject) the call to the 3rd party API, to check how the input data to API Client class method gets processed and formatted when it reaches the 3rd party API call.
3. Return canned server responses, to check how our program responds and processes each response.

Since the tests will be characterization tests, I will be just using the output generated by the code run by the test runner.

I am not sure how to generate inputs. The payloads are pretty complex objects, which can have ~30 fields (parameters) for some endpoints.

I don't think it is realistic to test all possible combinations of input parameters. Here's my plan:

- For each test, create a test input that's as typical as possible using the real payload. Save it in a file, as a fixture.
- Identify some fields that are interesting, important, or have previously caused errors. Create test cases for these fields. Load the fixture, and in each test case, overwrite a field in the payload with an extreme value, boundary value, or an illegal value, and making assertions with each payload. For example, if field A should be in range 5 &lt; A &lt; 15, with A = 5, A = 15, A = 4, A = 14, A = nil, etc.
- Run the test with failing expected values. Copy the actual output from the test runner, paste into expected values.

I am not sure if 1. this is the correct way to do characterization tests, and 2. this is a good way to create test input data. Am I overdoing it? Or doing it completely wrong?

Something like swagger-ui where you can select from a list of all configured services.

I imagine it as a kind of standalone API-docs server where you configure multiple sources, like
```
sources:
  app1: https://foo.host:8080/api/openapidocs
  app2: https://bar.host:8080/api/openapidocs
```

And then I can run the API doc portal without these services knowing or caring about it. FWIW the services are written in Java/Spring. We do provide the API specification in OAS 3.0 in the services already.

I realize this can be done with Spring Cloud, but it requires a bunch of service registry stuff like Eureka etc that we don't want to bloat or environment with. The services are already running fine with service discovery etc handled elsewhere (mostly native kubernetes)."

So this was a kind of a thought experiment for fun. 

This post is a bit tongue in cheek but the result was cute and it was fun. Nothing here to be taken seriously. 

tldr: made a tiny blogging thing for the terminal using bash scripts because bored and fun. 

I read a blog post about the problem of website bloat. The blog post itself came in at a fairly heft weight already, irony, and it got me thinking about what the smallest and lightweight blogging platform I could “invent” in an afternoon was. Here was the catch though, I didn’t just want to go light on bandwidth I wanted to go light on system resources too; so the browser had to go. 

Here was the “brief” in general:

1. As light on system resources as possible (no to browser)
2. Some mechanism for creating new posts akin to a new post button. 
3. Must have some kind of “standard” to make it easy to implement and read.
3.5 must be able to live alongside an existing website without trouble. 
4. Must include some way to make posts pretty. 
5. Don’t waste too much time on this nonsense. 
6. Fun. 

Now i will talk you through my thought process and what I ended up doing. 

As I had settled on abandoning the bloat of a browser I settled on this new fangled “blog” running in the browser. I would create a little ncurses tool that allows you to write content read other people’s! Simple enough. I started developing straight away tapping at my keyboard this way and that. Line after line of beautiful C sprung from my fingertips, until... it dawned on my that everything I needed to do was already available to me. All I needed to do was join the bits together!

To BASH I ran. I wrote a small script that created incrementally numbered posts, it even inserted a post date and an underlined title for you. Taking advantage of the ansi escape sequences for setting tex colour provided the way to make text “pretty”

These files could be uploaded to an existing site, be read with the curl command and the text would come out nicely formatted. The curl blog (clog) was born. 

If we made it standard that these posts went in a /clog in your website root there would be a definite location for all existing clogs to exist!

I then chose to make the file “index” a mandatory file to have in your clog and it would list all of the available posts you could read in it. The new post script was changed to now put the new post at the end of the index file. 

You could just check if /clog/index existed to see if a site had a working clog. 

Long(er) story short I ran back to bash and wrote a tiny little clog viewer that can also manage bookmarks! 

Anyway this was just a bit of fun on an afternoon but as it turns out there are now three active clogs and a webring of clogs to match. 

For the curious: https://github.com/jameschip/clogs

And before anyone says or asks: yes this is just serving up text files. Yes someone probably has done something similar before. No this isn’t a serious project its just for fun and I don’t suggest people adopting it. The point is that sometimes in software engineering doing fancy things is tempting, but we can often recombine the things we have to get a job done without having to rework the wheel."

I've done the task of ""re-making"" a program for another platform once before and while it was rather simple to do, I didn't do any of the planning or conceptual modelling that I now am familiar with. Are there generally accepted methods of attacking a problem like this?

The main example I was thinking of was Minecraft (Java) and its cross-platform replication, Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (in C#). I feel that, while assets are reused between the two, the re-creation of core system elements should follow a methodical design philosophy. Now that Bedrock Edition has caught up with the Java version, how would they go about programming / planning the same new features for both editions?"

Both me and my team have put in insane hours the last 6 months. I never once had to ask my team to do any over time.  They always stepped up and did whatever needed to happen with no prodding.  I am very proud of the work they and I did.  

I feel very bad they had to put in this much unpaid over time.  Our company took a financial hit with the pandemic, so chances of being able to give them a bonus are small.

I have told them many times how much I appreciate their extra work and now that we have launched, I have asked each them to schedule some time off.

I am asking for suggestions on anything I can do to show appreciation?  Especially now that our bonus budget has been cut.

I am not a developer in any way. I'm just a musician with a great idea. I'm just wondering how challenging it would be to pull off...

Here's my concept:

Musicians have been using live looping pedals and software increasingly more over time (Boss Rc-505, Abelton), and live streaming has effectively become the new industry standard for working musicians to perform. As much as I would love to watch myself and other live looping artists click a pedal and stand there listening to my own sounds on loop as I prepare my next instrument, I think there's a more entertaining solution...

What I need is software that not only loops the audio, but the video with it! As you hit your first command, your software starts recording the audio and video. Then with a second command it instantly begins playback of both audio and video together as a ""track"", looping it indefinitely. All while the video automatically organizes itself in frame to never cover up the the shots. There would also be an audio mixer section where you can control the volume of each loop and reorder loops.

So you would probably need some way to predetermine how the layers interact with each other. As soon as you execute the first loop, you now effectively have 2 camera angles (one live, one looping). So the software would automatically transition into a new ""scene"" where both angles are showing next to each other. And as you add more loop layers, it seamlessly transitions into preset scenes determined by how many loops you have running. Eventually it would up looking like some Brady Bunch-esque video with only one of the frames live.

This would then need to be sent to video broadcasting software like Open Broadcaster Software using a video capture device source and be sent out for streaming.

I'm not certain how much RAM power this could potentially require because I'm sure there's no time to write the file to a disk. Especially at 1080p, although only 720p would be needed at most considering all streaming platforms only support a maximum bitrate of 4000-8000 anyway.

If anybody in the magical land on Reddit that has the resources can make my dream software possible, take the idea and run with it! I would love to help with the design and I would be forever in your debt.

I'm mainly curious about the challenge to usefulness ratio and if would even be worth a company's time to develop something this ambitious. Please discuss! I've always been interested in software development but have spent my years learning chords and lyrics instead. 

Thanks for reading!"

I've learnt on my own and from older colleagues.

Now, since few years I feel that things are getting **crazy**!!! Each blog just shows limited piece of information, e.g.:

- concurrent updates to DB. It's so obvious topic, yet it's barely mentioned in any EFCore course. Some courses assumes like there's always 1 user and 1 machine. What if 2 editors edits same product in same time? 

- CQRS, one say use EventSourcing, another say use separate DBs for read and write, yet another that just different models are fine.

- distributed systems. One say use SQS, another says use Kafka. Other claim to use NServiceBus on top of it. Sure - it depends - but how someone without huge experience in distributed systems can make a good decision?

- or events dispatching: some push it directly to message bus, others use ""outbox"" pattern (I've spend days before I found blog where someone finally made distinction between internal and external events)

Little bit of knowledge at pluralsight, little bit at stackoverflow, little bit at YouTube, and little bit in blogs, etc.

Last thing I want is to reinvent a wheel and overengineer my project.

And at the end of a day, I found myself writing 10x more infrastructure code, rather than business code.

Do you also have like this? Always some piece of knowledge missing? Always some part of architecture done wrongly?

P.s.
I imagine that in other industries there are some well established patterns, e.g. build a bridge like that, and that's it. A bridge constructor doesn't gather knowledge scattered between BridgeOverflow.com and endless blogs. Does he?"

My problem is that I want there to be different game modes defining how the game logic behaves, while also having different ways to display graphics (In the terminal, a 2D GUI, and on a 3D board) 

My first thought was to have something like the following pseudocode

    class ChessGame {  
        ChessBoard board; //Model  
        BoardGraphics graphics; //View. 
        Controller white; //Controllers.

            graphics.move(move);
        }
    }  
With board, graphics, white, black all having a reference to their parent ChessGame, which is how they will communicate with the other sibling components. Each game mode would be a subclass ChessGame and override the makeMove method. 

** The problem is that a Controller might have to depend on the Graphics in order to select a move. For example, in a GUI interface, you would need to click on a piece in the view in order to make a move... and from inside my controller object I can’t just assume that my ChessGame instance has a GUI. **

So I thought maybe I need to make a subclass GUIChessGame and have a GUIController. But subclasses of ChessGame are supposed to define the game’s mode. How should I solve this without multiple inheritance?"

SWE vs Computer Science Hello, I could really use some insight. I am very afraid to go down a path to nowhere once again.

I graduated in 2019 with an EE degree, with a good GPA, and because I couldn't find work I decided to go back to school for a masters. Because I have interests in SW I decided to go with SWE. At my school if you do not have a BS in the field already you have to take a few sort of ""catch up"" classes. Because of my curriculum they only made me take a CS database design course and a  mathematical structures of CS course. Now I am in the SWE program. Problem is IDK if this degree will allow me to get a job. When I look online, even at jobs titled ""software engineer"", they ask for a CS degree. On top of that I really enjoyed that database class and working with SQL, but everything in data science also says ""CS degree"" when I look on Glassdoor and such. The other issue is all of the data classes like machine learning are locked in the CS department. After talking with the head of the SWE department she told me that if I really wanted I could use two of the CS classes as electives as the SWE masters has 4 open slots for electives. I thought maybe I could get the best of both worlds if I do the SWE degree and just take the course on machine learning and one on big data from the CS department. 

I don't know, I am just so afraid of walking away empty like I did with my bachelors. I just want to be hired, I want to work so bad."

We are also thinking of the possibility of holding MCQ tests on the site itself. I know that solutions to each of this is already available but the thing is that the school is located at a very remote place where students don't know enough to use stuff like Microsoft Teams etc and Internet connection isn't stable here to hold online classes anyway.

I can't figure out how I want to be interviewed and I'm interviewing others.

Interviewing for a mid developer, approaches and issues...

To clarify my definition of a mid developer is someone who is capable of getting a set of requirements and producing working production ready software from them with little help for a majority of tasks once up to speed with the company. The design would be reviewed still by a senior developer, and someone would do a code review and user testing after of course.

Phone call: Talk, see how the person fits, talk about past experience, what they would do in certain situations... This doesn't test anything about ability and could be good for a junior hire that is expected to learn on a the job or a senior hire that is expected to run the team instead of coding where different skills are actually needed.

White boarding: Normally tests fundamentals, algos and data structures. A person with 5 years developing may just not have a use for the algo ask about or isn't up to date with the latest terminology... but the recent masters student who has 0 hands on coding can ace it. Hire them and after the expected onboarding time they are struggling to write code in projects with a quarter million lines because they are used to school one off projects.

In person (live) coding: Takes time from both sides, feels super pressured with someone watching what you are typing, and probably avoiding cheating (Google/Stack Overflow) even though that is what real life programming often is and expected.

Take Home Test/Project: Takes lots of time from person applying and viewed negatively due to this. It does test the persons ability to deliver especially in a COVID environment where everyone is WFH anyway. I think ""cheating"" is expected, if you can source a template, 20 packages and write 100 lines of code, great instead of 1000, great. The only thing I would say that is not allowed is copying entire program from the internet and having someone else to do it. The follow up talking interview where the code is reviewed though should establish if the interviewee coded it. Could do a little bit of live coding also to test for that.

Other approaches, thoughts on which you prefer or how you would do it?"

Holy crap do I feel like a hero! :D I mean, I feel like it's incredibly lucky that I was able to impress the company with my zero work experience enough to receive an offer during these times.

I haven't yet received the offer letter, and while I squirm in anticipation, I thought I would ask a few wage-related questions to the community. Namely, is it ridiculous for me to consider negotiating a salary after the offer comes through?

Early on, we discussed a figure which they agreed was reasonable (but then they made an ""iffy"" face over the video chat). I mentioned that I'm not hard-set on that number and he made a note of that.

The interviews were nothing but wonderful with the lead dev, hiring manager and CTO. High praise all around. Then today, the hiring manager playfully starts by telling me that they'd received a record-setting number of applicants in all his years at the company and that I'd climbed to the top and they'd like to bring me aboard. That I'd be receiving an official offer letter from HR soon and I'd come and pick up some gear before beginning.

Hallelujah!!

After the high wore off a bit, I realized there was no mention of salary.

Is this normal? Does that (probably... possibly)  mean they've agreed to the figure we discussed earlier? If it's lower than we discussed, do you think it's negotiable? Will they scoff at my counter-offer and snapback their original proposal and laugh at my face? Should I take a lesson in humility during this pandemic and thank all the Gods that an inexperienced nerd has a pretty reasonable gig lined up?

I read a bunch of articles online on this but I'm still not 100% convinced which one is the right choice for me so I'm hoping someone's perspective here might help me make the correct decision.

Okay so my background is I have done my Bachelors in CS and have been working with an MNC(the ecommerce giant) for the last 3 years. I was promoted to an SDE-2 after 2 years and now I'm working towards becoming an SDE-3. I have been a part of my team since the beginning and since last 6-8 months I have been feeling like my learning curve is almost flat and things are becoming boring.

I have an offer from a fintech startup where one of my friend works which has completed series A funding and the founder is second time entrepreneur who has sold his first startup for 300M $. The current team there is around 80 people.

As per my conversation with the manager of the team in the start-up, his selling point was that the learning opportunities are going to be immense and even if the startup does not work out in 3 years, I'll have enough technical knowledge to join as an SDE-3 back in my current company. And if it does, I could grow exponentially with it and reach higher levels as compared to a liner growth at my current MNC.


The other option I'm considering is joining a different team here at my current company which might be working on interesting things. I don't even know how long it'll take to become SDE-3 here since the attrition rate is very low here now and I see there are so many SDE-2s already. I'm also scared my knowledge base will be significantly lower than my friend at the startup 3-4 years from now. How do you think should I approach this decision? What are your thoughts? 


P.S. - Working hours at the startup might be a little hectic but I'm okay to put in a little extra effort since I'm super young and I dont have many other responsibilities. Pay at the startup is almost similar to what my current company is paying."

Should I finish pursuing my degree? The problem is right now that if I stop, I'll have everything paid off and no student loans etc. If I do drop I'll most likely end up doing more self-taught than anything, so I won't be giving up on the field.

When I was hired, I agreed to a junior level position with the opportunity to quickly move into a mid level engineer position once I reached my 6 month review if I meet certain criteria. I recently spoke to my manager who said that I had been performing at the expectations of the mid level engineer position and that in the next 2 weeks we would discuss the details of the new position. I do not expect my day to day responsibilities to change. The detail I am struggling with is what salary I should accept.

Here are the details. My manager has said that I am at a 5 out of 5 skill level with React, which I use day to day more than anything else. I am working in a Full stack position. I rate myself at a 4 out of 5 with working on a Nodejs backend. The projects I have been working on are Cloud Native applications and I rate myself at about a 3 out of 5 level of skill with Cloud Technologies (server-less hosting, server-less functions, build pipelines, containers, etc...) and I have demonstrated the ability to quickly pick up new tools. My weakest skill going into this position was testing which is something I have improved faster than any of my other skills. I currently have a salary package worth 65k. I am 90% done with a CS degree that I am completing on the side.

My manager said that as I move into this mid level position, that ""I know what I should be making."" I have a rough idea that I should expect / ask for something around the value of 90k. I have not been able to find anyone in my network that is or recently has been in a comparable position. It would be helpful to know what to value myself at before I ask for too much or too little. If anyone has been in this situation, please let me know."

I'm not saying you should, but can they? I'm getting confused. All articles and books I have read talk about using distributed transactions across multiple ""sites"" or partitions of the same database. But then I read an article talking about why they perform poorly in microservice architecture when using separate isolated databases. Assuming that each microservice uses the same database technology and supports distributed transactions (i.e. has support for 2PC and locking etc...) can each separate DB take part in distributed transactions? Or is it restricted to a single database across their partitions/sites? Also, I'm relatively new to this terminology so maybe I'm misunderstanding how partitions work, or what a ""site"" really is so please correct me if I'm wrong on this.

Sorry if this question is dumb, I'm just a uni student trying to make sense of how they work :)

EDIT: Maybe a better question is why are traditional distributed transactions okay to use across multiple partitions of the same database but perform poorly across multiple database systems. What's the difference? This is the article I read: https://thorben-janssen.com/distributed-transactions-microservices/"

Every Nth event requires manual intervention. The issue that happens is some programmers deliver projects that haven't been touched in years since they were deployed and are heavily used every day, while others spend 1/4 of every sprint for the past many years supporting the projects they release.

When we look at the issues, it seems like very very minor issues. From that perspective, they're all very similar in performance. But those minor issues add up when make a huge difference in support costs.

I'm not talking about a single project. We have programmers who have been here for many years and have developed many many projects. Individually those projects have low support costs, but they only accumulate over time.

The resulting support cost of a project seems to be bimodal. Some people almost never have to support their systems and other people are constantly fixing some yet another ""unforeseen"" edge case.

When looking over system design difference, the systems with edge cases seem to handle edge cases as an implementation detail. Systems with few issues seem to be designed in a way to not even allow for these kinds of edge cases. It comes down to the difference between ""that shouldn't happen"" and ""that can't happen"".

This also leads to small perceived difference in quality can lead to huge difference in long term outcomes. And I am by no means saying these people are not creating quality products."

I am newly out of an academic environment in a more professional setting as a software developer, and really love my job. Now, instead of working on one thing for many months, I typically work on a couple of bigger projects at a time, though I have a lot of freedom how I choose to divide up my time each day/week (e.g., I can do project A and project B every day, or alternate days, or whatever, as long as I get my work done).

My main problem is I am frankly not that good yet at juggling multiple projects. I was sort of spoiled before focusing on one main thing until it was done, maybe with some smaller side projects. Now I have like 2-3 big projects, and I'm finding I'm not the greatest at switching gears. There is a nontrivial cognitive overhead to it in addition to just literal time cost in terms of setting up my virtual environments etc in Python. 

So I'm curious how people handle this. Do you set aside blocks of hours, days, or what, for your different projects? Are there tricks (organizational or code-based) that have helped you become more efficient at switching? What have you found to be the best strategy? When you are really in a groove on project A and being super productive, but know it is time to switch to project B, what do you do?

What is happening is I naturally am finding I tend to want to work on something for about 3 days, but then I am already sort of rusty on the other projects. So there is an impedance mismatch between the rust accumulation and my more natural tendency to just dive in and focus with 100% energy for a few days at a time. 

I really want to be productive and get over this academic holdover and be more productive in this more professional setting."

Unfortunately, this need often isn't evident at the beginning of the cloud-native journey. Development environments are an afterthought: a cumbersome, heavy, brittle drag on productivity.  


The best teams treat development environments as a priority and devote significant DevOps/SRE time to perfecting them.

Computer Science isn't Software Engineering.

I figure it is best I just ask a question that is based on what I am interested in so..

IF, for example.. I had a problem solution situation. 

A golf course has a lot of grass, I need to build a sprinkling system that saves water, also is hooked up to solar, and is so simple to operate it either runs itself, or a 99-year-old could do it.  These are three different fields of engineering. 

Help explain  the concept for the physical system itself,  but not actually DESIGN the system. I love art and the final project more than anything don't get me wrong. So,  I know ideal the solar panels should be mirror colored and outside.  I know water runs through pipes and gravity and temperature are its friend and enemy all at once... But that isn't where I see me. 

How am I going to make sure this turns on, when this other system also turns off.  All of those functions to support  that the final process, and that entire programmed was executed and guess what, all you need to do is mow the grass.

Where do I fit in? 

I want to help make the program that runs it, and just that. I want to help make it convenient for the user, I can imagine having to press a button at the golf course... must be ravishing. (that really was a random example) 

That is what I think about,  what kind of information would the user want? Does that grass need to be mowed? I could think of a million things that the system would measure and share. I want to help it measure and share it with.... Golfers.

I also want a 11 year old to be able to teach a 100 year old how to work it.

&amp;#x200B;

It was the last two and half paragraphs where I realized I had probably lost most people. I was lost. I was so far in I decided to finish.  It's just school stress and running out of time. 

&amp;#x200B;

For what it's worth, I want my minor to be in communications."

He explains “sort of” explaining that if there are problems and he’s the one to fix them then he looks good and it’s better for his career. Then sometimes it’s legitimate that he really is required to fix a huge issue. 
I understand both these are good things but still wish there was a way he could let someone else have a turn fixing things once in a while. 

It ends up with me still unsatisfied but grateful he does what he does.  He has also explained to me in the past that if there is a problem or something he is working on, he mentally can’t stop doing it because it will nag at him and he can’t focus on anything else until it’s done. 
So after that explanation, is this normal and something I should just expect and live with? He thinks he doesn’t work late that often but I think he confuses that with “required to work” and “just working by choice”. Either way, he is on the computer sitting on the couch or in his office. Please advise? What can I say or ask to helpfully make things better? 
Oh and to add, he’s a team lead.

In all other things we have a great marriage. We communicate well. Work through problems respectfully. We express our love daily and have amazing inside jokes. This one issue just seems to never be resolved."

I am currently rocking dual 22"" 1080p Acer monitors and my 16"" MBP on an adjustable stand. I've got a Corsair mechanical keyboard, and a Magic Trackpad (the mouse is for my desktop). The HomePod was a recent but welcome addition for listening to music. The vertical phone charging stand is also a must have. I've seen so many people try and flex about their wireless charger but it was just a circle on the desk which is so completely useless.

Software wise: I usually operate with \~10 different IntelliJ windows on the middle monitor (different spaces), chrome on the left screen (with postman on the space to the left of chrome) and then slack / email / other communication on the right display.

I have been considering going widescreen for a while but the thing holding me back most is my attachment to Mac OS's swipeable screens. Sure, you can resize them (Rectangle App is a great free tool) but my typical workflow involves having around 10 fullscreen instances of IntelliJ which I swipe between (or use Exposee) freely. And a single widescreen monitor, although more real estate, would hinder my ability to do that. I'm still waiting for the day someone makes a virtual spaces extension."

As Solutions Architect I use the mission, goals and feature requirements to develop a functional solution.

Also from the Statement Of Work I would develop wireframes and user journeys...

Then into project kick-off I would create a backlog of items in Jira or Trello and start creating two week sprints from this backlog.... so on and so forth Sprints and later Phase 2...

Briefly about me, I am a software engineer with 8+ years of experience, doing mostly backend and data processing (Java, C++, C#, Python, etc). I have been with one of FAANG companies (in Canada) for last 4 years, but I am disgusted and tired. My Corp is a huge feature factory where the only thing that is valued is to deliver cr\*p as fast as you can. As a result, 90% of my time is wasted of putting out fires. I tried switching teams several times, but it is all about the same. Plus no real career growth and tons of bureaucracy.

This made me seriously think of switching to contract-based work. What I am seeking is: a) More fulfilling job (more coding, deliver nice things) and b) better career perspectives.  The only thing that really worries me is getting those contracts, I can't imagine having no job or contract to work on :)

I have a BS in Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, but outside of some basic programming classes 10 years ago, I really am new to the whole Computer Science, Engineer, Programmer, Software Engineer field. 

So here are my questions:

(1) With a BS in Computer Science &amp; Engineering, what kind of jobs are available to me? Granted, I know a large part of the industry is not just proving you have a degree - but having years of experience writing code or being involve in computers, but please any information would be helpful. 

(2) Is there a differ between Software Engineer and Programmer? What kind of hierarchy's are there for job responsibility and seniority? 

(3) You always hear how companies like Amazon work crazy hows. I def want to have my career be a part of my life, but with a family I wouldn't really want to turn my career into something where I work all the time. What kind of hours are we looking at for a typical engineer? Do you hear often that these workers are allowed to have flexibility to work from home often? Not just Amazon, but any of these companies who hire

(4) What are salaries at typical places. You always hear liek Amazon hires entry level software engineers for nearly 6 figures. Is that true? Whats the standard in the industry though? How high can you climb and still be realistic in job opportunity. 

(4) What are some things I should learn over the next 1-3 years to have a good shot at getting a job? Even if its just entry? I am sure the biggest different between entry and senior is just experience."

Driving me nuts So we work with a particular open-source modular platform that's primarily plug-in-based and that isn't WordPress, and we provide our clients with online learning solutions tailored to their specific needs. 

Without going into too many details, our entire dev cycle is FUBAR. The senior devs don't support the decision to use any kind of deployment tools and it's more than likely the younger guys will be responsible for reinventing the wheel. 

Just to give you an idea of my working environment. 

But they pay me well and the name is an excellent first entry on my resume. 

The process goes like this: PMs meet with client to determine requirements. They start with UI/UX designs that make client happy with the flashy colors and smooth animations. Issue cards are determined. Devs come in last to learn about what they're supposed to implement. 

As you can probably tell, devs have little to no input on anything like design or architecture, yet even the senior level guys are subjected to this. We're basically just expected to glue plug-ins together to achieve the desired purpose or tailor a new plug-in to this client's needs that isn't going to be reusable given the timeframe we have to get it done. 

It's patchy work. Enter design guy who draws up fantastical wireframes that absolutely do not share the same ethos as said modular platform. He then proceeds to blame the front-end guys for not being able to achieve these galactical feats in drawing shit on Zeplin. We're then expected to translate this using our internal design system (because fuck popular frameworks like Bootstrap) that is very barebones and poorly documented. 

When we argue that these designs absolutely break the flow of the entire platform and will not provide consistency, design guy snickers and says ""no it can be done"" without sharing the knowledge he doesn't have to be able to make that claim. 

But he has a senior PM's ears because he's the only one she can have a conversation with without retreating into non-technical territory. He fucking draws shit on a whiteboard, I don't expect anything less. 

I was fine with all of this until he threw a couple of guys on my team under the bus on a call they weren't on today. He also wants to lecture me on his ""UX cookbook"" and how we can remedy this problem in future projects. And now the UX guy is going to be responsible for drafting a plan of attack for us to approach the next project we embark on without any kind of analysis or preparation other than drawing buttons and fancy text boxes. 

Thanks for coming to my ted talk."

However, I am working with one other guy and only this one guy, and he is a very unpleasant person.

It is hard for me to switch to a different approach because for me the easiest way to understand the problem is to make real changes. I can't grasp the code and predict everything without making any change in the code so it's also hard for me to estimate the time needed for implementation.

My question is whether or not I should take next term off to learn some core CS stuff. Operating systems/compilers/concurrency. I am not a CS student, so I have this chip on my shoulder for not learning these fundamentals.

I also think delaying graduation in this market would be beneficial, giving me more internship search time. Intern -&gt; new grad offer is easier than graduate -&gt; straight to new grad. For example, I heard Facebook mostly hires interns for their new grads

As part of my self-teaching journey in software engineering/design I tried to implement a simplified version of Uncle Bob's original example on SRP. My premise is as follows:

&gt; I got to implement a *Worker* class, whose info can be stored and payment can be calculated

Now, trying to make my modules independent, I came up with the following code (python)

```
# - - - - - - - - - - - - 
# Worker.py
# - - - - - - - - - - - - 
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, name, age, years_working):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.years_working = years_working

# - - - - - - - - - - - - 
# Accounting.py
# - - - - - - - - - - - - 
YEARS_WORKING_FACTOR = {
        ""SOLES"": 1000,
        ""DOLLARS"": 500
    }
WORKER_AGE_FACTOR = 300

def get_salary(worker, currency='DOLLARS'):
    return YEARS_WORKING_FACTOR[currency] * worker.years_working + WORKER_AGE_FACTOR * worker.age

# - - - - - - - - - - - - 
# DBManagement.py
# - - - - - - - - - - - - 
DB = []

def save_worker(worker):
    worker_info = worker.__dict__
    worker_info['salary'] = get_salary(worker, 'SOLES')
    DB.append(worker.__dict__)

```

Now here:

* If someone requires some modification on the *Worker* definition, I would only modify it's class contained in its own module
* If someone requires some aditional currency to calculate the salary, I would only modify or add a new YEARS\_WORKING\_FACTOR field into *Accounting.py* module
* If someone needed to change the database to something else (like a dict or SQL reference), I would need to only change the DBManagment.py module

But what if I now needed to store the salary into the DB using ""Euros"" or another currency not defined in *Accounting* module, requiring me to change both *Accounting* and *DBManagment* logic. Would this violate the SRP? How would you approach the same scenario (in a pedagogical way)?"

Picture you, a dev, with a project with a bewildering mix of process workflow, coordination tasks, and built in automations. You have different systems interacting with eachother and you are divvying up responsibilities for your code base across this workflow. For example, the developer only worries about modules under x branch, after which in a later phase of the workflow a tester takes care of the modules under y branch. Consequently, you find elements of this process will consist of both static (e.g. how the code is organized) and dynamic (the activity and sequence of project actions) models. 

Do you rigidly stick to UMLs hard line and put the static in a class diagram and put the dynamic in an activity diagram, or would you irreverently mix both static and dynamic elements as part of one diagram? Why?"

I always got yearly salary increase, never got fired, never got low score (e.g. ""below expectations"").

Having ""best software"" in mind changed now.

My new company has pretty detailed career framework. Too much detailed. Basically you have to give concrete examples for vast majority of competency areas (there are 4x more soft skills areas, than tech skils).

What matters more than thorough understanding of technical architecture or ability to write clean code, is to give concrete examples of, e.g.:

- how you cooperate with different teams on a bugs solving (one example is not enough)

- how you helped overall company process

- how you fostered meetings so everyone felt comfortable sharing ideas

**I'm not denying importance of the above**, but what I'm asking is that if you also go to work, knowing that for next quarter you have to make proofs of these?

Instead of going to work having ""good software"" in mind, I'm going to work having ""how to make concrete examples"" for the career framework.

How is it with you fellow devs?"

I'm 23, and I have been trying to become a software engineer for a few months now (since Feb/March). My main focus is in front end - specializing in ReactJS (eventually I would want to become a full stack).   
I have been trying to teach myself and learn and practice after my full time job and then usually use my free weekends to work on this as well. I have created some small apps and projects so far. I have a friend/mentor but I feel like it's lacking in a way, they kinda throw things at me but lack direction/guidance and what have you.   


I've been using tools like Udemy courses/camps, YouTube, books, etc to help me learn and develop my skills. However, lately I just feel sort of stuck and frustrated with my growth or maybe lack of. I am 100 percent aware that this takes time and is challenging, that doesn't bother me. My concern or question is, has anyone who is self-taught experienced this and have any advice? What else can I be doing? Are there other resources to find mentors? I also still toggle with the idea of boot-camps and the promising job aspects (?), but again they are quite pricey and may not even be worth it. I've looked at internships but they all require you to be pursing a degree or in school etc so I wouldn't qualify for those.

I'm 16 and have just learned the basic fundamentals of C++ and C# so far. I'm really anxious and worried that I'm being too slow and that my skills will not be enough to take BSSE in college, which is two years from now. This anxiety is destroying my motivation to keep on learning, so I started to search if it's okay to take the course with little to none prior knowledge. Some say it's okay, but I still have doubts. I think I'm starting to lose passion, but I really don't want to.

A backstory:
I use to be passionate about being an illustrator since I was a child, but because of my parents pressuring me to excel in math, I didn't really have time to develop much. When I entered high school and joined the arts club (so I can finally have time to do what I enjoy), I saw that the people my age are significantly better than me, so it destroyed my passion for arts. The thought kept repeating in my head: ""You're too late. You're too late. You're too late."" I mean I still draw, but not as much anymore.

So I experimented: writing, photography, graphic design. I enjoyed all of them, but nothing really stuck with me. 

Just a year ago I discovered that I was pretty good at programming through our IT subject, so I decided that this will be my thing. I enjoyed figuring out how this and that works and sometimes I add more to the program. It all seemed like magic to me that it put a big smile on my face for the first time in a while (Maybe being pressured to do well in math helped this?). So I looked more into programming as a career path. I saw that a lot of people younger than me have started programming, and being the insecure person that I am, started comparing myself to them. 

""In two years, I'll be in college. I have done nothing significant but to learn the fundamentals of two languages, and I emphasize, just the fundamentals. I should just quit.""

""You're too late. You're too late. You're too late.""

I started attempting to motivate myself by watching software engineering tips, guides, etc. on Youtube, but that just made me more anxious and led me to a headache. 

So, am I too late?"

I'm new to the SE world. Graduated last year, landed a nice job this year and with my first 6 months under the belt I've been contemplating passive income.

At work we're doing a grad programme for the majority of the year, this takes up 2-3 weekends every 6 weeks. I've been learning a lot and at work my current responsibilities are creating nodejs micro services. I'm also getting some hands on experience with AWS which is really cool!

Currently I tend to do 50-60 hour work weeks without my weekend grad work. 

I've done the basics from computer repairs to hosting applications on my own little servers for side projects while I was studying. I like backend development a lot more than the front end, making things pretty feels like a lot of hassle. 😅

The main reason I'm posting this:

I want to start generating a passive income. I don't think I'll be able to avoid burnout if I do projects for clients that have deadlines, but maybe you guys have an idea of how I can generate some passive income while I finish up my grad programme? 

TLDR: How can I generate a passive income while avoiding burnout from my 50-60 hour work weeks?"

For instance when we get a new order, that order is placed on ""send confirmation email to customer"" and a bunch of other queues depending on what the customer has purchased. Some tasks span multiple queues (do this, then that).

We also have ""manual queues"" with a web UI listing all orders on each queue. Failed automatic queues are also listed. When an agent marks the order as manually handled for that queue, it can manually be put on the following queue if there is one.

This is all home made and works quite well for linear flows with branching. When a queue has processed an order it can put it on the next queue(s). But when one queue depends on two queues having finished before it, it becomes a mess to get it right and requires separately crafted solutions. So in short it works well for tree structures but not for DAGs (directed acyclic graphs).

The fact that we have 2 reviewers per ticket makes it even worse, when one of the reviewers don't like the changes suggested by the other one, and I have to undo stuff.  
Am I the only one feeling like this? I would like to know how you cope with the critiques. Do you have discussions with the reviewer? or just make the changes? I hate conflict, so if I say I disagree with something and the reviewer insists that I make the change I just end up doing it.  


Sorry for the rant, but I needed to get it off my chest, and would like to know other people feelings about this.

Thanks"

How would I find a skilled engineer as a co-founder to help me with these pursuits?

I feel if I pitched the idea to an engineer who saw no value in the idea, they wouldn't work with me. Conversely, I feel like an engineer who found lots of value in the idea would just execute something on their own with somebody who has better business acumen than me.

My current ideas are

1) learn to code and at least get the project up and running. Then find a co-founder once I need more complicated coding done. I do have some experience and would love to learn how to code myself, the only issue is that I suspect that my idea requires complex backend infrastructure and am also very serious about the UX and UI being near perfect.

2) Get prospective co-founder engineers to sign an Nda before I pitch them so that they cant steal my idea

3) Pitch the idea to software engineers anyway and stop being so worried about someone stealing my idea. If my idea could potentially be stolen and executed by an engineer who replaces me with someone who has better business acumen than me, then I was probably doomed from the start. I would hope that no engineer would be able to steal my idea and execute on it better than me, without me. I would hope that my vision, sales experience, marketing ideas, connections, and own unique way of thinking that led me to come up with this idea are essential to carrying out the idea.

If anyone has any better ideas or insights, they would be much appreciated.

One need to understand the problem (to some degree), before solving it. Totally obvious.

Nevertheless, to understand the problems (domain) takes a lot of knowledge, experience, natural talent and probably more - years of work (best case months). I'm talking here about big business projects.

In my first semester of engineering, I took a coding course (C++) that taught the basics of coding from the very beginner concepts to classes/OOP. I entered a depressive episode towards the end of the semester so my knowledge on anything past classes or OOP related is pretty scarce. I also took a data structures &amp; algorithms class in my second year. I really struggled through it because I lacked a strong foundational knowledge in the pre-requisites in comparison to my peers who were familiar with the material because of the first year course and their previous internships in a software engineering role. 

My current view is that coding/software development isn’t for everyone, and I am one of those people. I’m not like my classmates who have learned and picked up coding quick, are now super knowledgeable and talented at coding because of internships, courses, side projects, etc. 

I did an internship in web development in my first year but it did not go very well. I was very lost and lacked direction and knowledge for all my tasks. After that experience, I told myself I’d never go back to a software engineering role because of how anxious I was and how incompetent I felt during that internship. 

Now, with the pandemic, I’ve been considering the direction that my career is heading because my past four internships have been a bit all over the place in different positions and industries (my engineering major is quite broad). I thought I would never do a dev internship again, but I’ve been considering re-learning how to code and explore software engineering a bit more. I’m just not sure if this is feasible or recommended. Should this switch even be something to consider? Should I just pursue a different career path? Thoughts?

TLDR: is it too late for me to become good at coding and pursue a software engineering career? is it possible for me to become as great as a “naturally talented” software engineer, and love it despite having a poor foundation in the basics?

When I was first breaking into the field, a lot of people told me I should instead look into software engineering/development because of my personality and the pay. I didn’t take the advice because I took an introductory course in Java during undergrad and I hated it. I earned a B+ in the course, but it was unnaturally difficult for me, and I was overwhelmed the entire time (prior to the class I never had any exposure with a programming language).

Given that I’ve had this much difficulty with Java in the past, would it still be possible to become a software engineer and focus more on other languages? If I hated Java that much, is it even worth trying to learn Python/Ruby/C++/PHP to see if I’m more comfortable with them? If it means anything, I do know a little SQL and I have the entry-level cert from Microsoft in it.



EDIT: 

Thank you all for your responses. After reading what everyone had to say, it indeed seems the issue was with programming in general (and the lack of timing I had to learn it), not Java itself. I’ve decided to give it another chance and learn the basics at my own pace. Thank you all for your insight!"

Then there is the obvious—work really hard at the company I’m at and get promoted/pay raises. The only thing is that this company is not good at properly compensating people for going above and beyond (at least, that’s what I’ve been told).

I’m an Software Engineer 1, with two years of experience and a CS degree. Should I try to go for a senior position at a different company? Should I stick it out here and hope for a raise? Should I do something else entirely?

I'm working mostly with Microsoft tech stack revolving around Dynamics AX along with .NET for any integration, middleware etc.

For a while now I'm feeling like I'm stuck working on such a specific ""product"" you could say and that I'm limiting my options if I ever want to try and do something else moving forward. I mean sure I like working with the tech but I believe it's restricting me from experiencing some more traditional development that's going on like building whole applications from the ground up and all that.

Lately I've been applying to A LOT of different companies for a Software Engineer position, for .NET and C# positions but I THINK I'm being rejected without even going through a test or anything because my CV basically screams Dynamics AX at this point and people think that hinders my ability to code because it's such a specific product that I'm working on. That's not really helping my mental state. I constantly think that I'm just not even a decent enough developer.

Although to be fair I'm mostly applying in European companies while I'm still in Asia so the whole needing a work VISA and all might be a reason for the rejection too but I guess you guys can comment better on this.

I'm just in a very confused state right now as to what I should do moving forward. I would love to hear what experienced engineers think."

My husband has been looking for an entry level software engineer position since December 2019 without any luck. Yesterday, he once again told me that he’s got a rejection email from a company where he thought he had a great interview at. 

Back story: My husband and I are in our mid 30s living in NYC and we’ve been married for 7 years. 4 years ago he was working in sales and marketing, he wasn’t thriving and got tired of his job. He started to learn coding by himself and decided that coding is something he would be enjoy doing as a job. After some thinking, he and I both agreed that he should quit his job and go to a 3 month coding boot camp to see if this can turn into something he would be love doing. 

3 month past, after several failed attempts for the boot camp entry exams, he then decided that he wanted to get a bachelor’s degree for computer science since he realized that boot camps are not legit. He already has a bachelors degree in marketing and business. I struggled to agree with that since that would take him 3-4 more years to finish. Even though I have a pretty decent job and salary(I am not a software engineer), I still think that’s a lot burdens on my shoulder which I am not ready for. He had always make less than me before he quit his job, but I would never thought that I will have to pay for all expenses while he’s in school for 3-4 years. It’s expensive living in NYC. I disagreed at first but he insisted and got his parents involved. They begged me to let him go to school and just suck up for 4 years. they said they will help as much as possible. I looked at him and knowing that he hates his old job and I agreed. 

Luckily he was able to get his bachelors degree in computer science in 3.5 years and during this time, not only I was working full time to financially support him and myself, I was also the one that cleans and cooks since he was always busy studying. His parents did not help much as they said they would. but I was looking forward for him to finish so he can finally have a job. Because if this, I did not buy anything  nice or go to vacations for 4 years. Thinking about us finally can enjoy our lives a little bit kept me going during these 4 years. 

Little did I know, 7 month after he graduated, he still did not get an offer. He applied numerous job applications since December and got a few interviews. Right before the lockdown started for Covid, he was interviewing at 3 different companies. He said he was doing great. When covid started, 2 of the companies paused hiring. The last company had 3 technical interviews with him, on his final interview, they had 5 software engineers on the zoom call asking him technical questions and he said he aced it. We were excited and thought that this was going to be his big break. But after 2 month and several follow up emails, he got a rejection email during the lock down. Covid and the economy definitely does not help with his job searching. Finally he got an interview at a big company last week, he answered all the technical questions correctly during the interview(he asked the interviewer at the end), still a rejection....

I am emotionally and financially drained from his situation. Every time I think about his situation, I just fall into a depression episode. I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel... Sorry about the ramble. But can anybody who has the experience tell me if it is true that it’s this difficult to find a entry level software developer job? Is it because he’s unlucky or is he not good enough? 

here is his programming skills he listed on his resume:

• JavaScript, jQuery, Java, PHP
• C++, Node.js, Express.js, Heroku, React and Redux, Angular
• MongoDB, mySQL, SQL
• HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, EJS

He doesn’t know that I am posting this on Reddit. I needed some advice and insight from someone else other than him. Thanks for any feedback..


Edit: I forgot to mention that he did have 2 internships during his school years. He also is searching everywhere not limited to NYC.


Edit: thank you all for your valuable feedback. I feel a little less sad and a little more encouraged now. I wish I can help him as much as I can but my knowledge to this industry is so limited. At this point he has no choice but keep at it with your advices. Thankfully he has not been discouraged at all with the rejections and he’s been studying harder and harder. Hopefully he will get more technical interviews so that he can be more motivated. 🙏🏼"

(It might be a bit ranty, but help me clean up my understanding, or just stay for the anecdotes.)

Being in the software world for some time, I have my steady stream of incoming generic requests and messages about jobs on Linkedin. If you've been working in software, you probably know what I'm talking about, it is probably not unique to me. If not, you can draw a parallel, between being a hot girl on tinder and being a software engineer on Linkedin. Your seniority is the analog for the amount of cleavage displayed on your photos, the recruiters are the guys trying to get your attention, and your profile is your tinder-bio, which they won't read until you actually respond.

Recruiters, their existence just boggles me. What is the added benefit, other than the means for a wealty company to buy attention, through human-disguised ads, and shameless attempts to slip in your DMs? I've been interviewing with companies, and I've been interviewing candidates who are represented by agents, so I see those two angles, but not the recruiters'.

From the engineer's perspective, I don't think it makes a lot of sense. My experience so far has only been poor. (Here's where your views can come in).

* I see how they try to oversell me to the company, and oversell the company to me.
* They try to act important throughout the process, they'd try to get my view on the interviews, and offer help for the next ones (I never really understood how they could be of any help in preparing for a technical interview in any shape, but maybe this is circumstancial).
* They act as a middle-man between me and the company, introducing delays in communication, miscommunication and headache just in general.
* Ultimately, they'll take a cut of my salary. It's of course not directly from my salary, but the money the company has to pay them as an extra goes from the same budget that I'm getting my draw from.

From the companies' perspective, they're bringing an expensive but steady stream of incoming candidates, with an extra premium on a successful hire. But they also act as cannibals trying to tear out other employees of yours with promises of a brighter, richer future.

From the recruiter's side, this completely makes sense. It's a lucrative business. They get a hefty cut of the engineers' salary for their search. Once the engineer is placed, champagne pops and onto the next one. You can promise anything to get them going, and if the offer is not great, you're still good with almost no investment in-between.

And most of this work can be EASILY replaced by a robot - since all my interactions with recruiters, especially in the early phases are completely repetitive and bland. Same questions, different reader on the other end. I would like to believe, that robots can actually tell the difference between Java and Javascript. This job should be an extremely endangered one, and yet, they spread like fungi on wet cowdung.

I feel some reassurance about this now. Coming from the video production industry I've already faced a monumental amount of rejection. I've been actively learning video production since the age of 12 and entered college with skills far beyond what any other video producer in my university was ever capable of. I considered myself on par skills-wise with big-name studio employees like video producers at HBO and Universal and all my professors assured me I could easily jump into the industry with my skillset. However, it took me 18 months to get an entry-level job making $38k in the DC area. I think that's why this career change has been so daunting. Hearing your input about SWE is wonderful. I can really say so far I have a passion for it. I enjoy learning and both my parents have been software engineers since the early '80s and I'm excited to follow in their footsteps.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently enrolled in an online cohort which is starting soon. I'm extremely excited and found the pre-modules to be easy to follow and realized I'm quick at learning this stuff after also doing a few projects I found online. I also realized how interested I am in coding and understanding how it all works. However, I'm worried about after the program.

So far, I haven't found any negative experiences online about getting a job but it still sounds a little too good to be true. They claim 95% of graduates get a job paying over $95k if you're willing to move to the San Francisco area and I am willing. I just worry from a logical standpoint trying to think of a reason why a company would want to hire someone who only has AppAcademy on their resume applying to be a software engineer. I've been a video producer for the last 5 years and have a lot of creative experience with web design and user experience which might be a plus and I also have a bachelor's degree in Telecommunications. What are your thoughts? Should I be worried?"

However, I'm slowly loosing hope. As example let me tell ""domain events"". I'm researching this toopic since few weeks. Here what I've found:

- dispatch before committing
- dispatch after committing
- divide into ""internal"" and ""external"" domain events, dispatch ""external"" after committing
- to ensure at-least-one delivery of ""external"" events, create outbox patter
- use domain events to communicate between bounded context only, within bound context use normal program flow
- use domain events also to communicate between aggregates
- trigger one domain event per command
- don't trigger domain events in commands, only in aggregates
- trigger domain events also in entities of aggregates
- store domain events in per-aggregate table
- store domain events in per-bounded-context table/store

... and more. The above are from blogs of many great developers (Udi, Khorikov, etc.) and very often they are in contradiction to each other.

Why in our industry it's so convoluted? Barely any standards if it is about more complex things than CRUD.

I know each system is different, but unless you're google or amazon, there should be pretty standard templates, e.g.:

- basic crud
- medium size ddd, cqrs (single monolith)
- large size ddd, cqrs (distributed)
- large size ddd, cqrs, event sourcing

1. The first challenge is that you may not know what your brand is. The topic of your engineering brand doesn’t tend to come up until you start thinking about how to represent it.

2. The second challenge is that it takes time and effort. Building your brand isn’t an engineering task, but you need people who take it seriously and keep up the effort. You want people to know that they can come back later for more great stuff to have a real impact.

3. When we started speaking at conferences and writing blog posts we realized that our own team is a key audience. Your blog is an effective way to communicate with your engineers.

With some reflection, I am dismayed at the tools at our disposal for encapsulation, and concurrently our appreciation of it. ""Public"" everything is all too common with occasional extracts of private methods.

It is my feeling this comes at an expensive cognitive cost to work with the code. Encapsulation constrains and organizes the surface area of the code.  By surface area, I mean what must be considered for understanding the code from the context of a business perspective, a calling perspective in code, or a dependency perspective.

At one extreme where everything sees everything else (public everything) there are very few assertions that are readily available when reading the code. You must manually enumerate the structure through static analysis. From a consuming perspective you have to manually delineate what the useful structure is from the non-useful structure. This can be exhausting for complex problems.

On the other extreme where everything is encapsulated well and locked down, assertions become self-evident. You only have to work with what you can see. The code communicates it's useful structure in a clear way.

So a few things:

1. In .NET projects are a great encapsulation tool, but often projects are used as layers which must effectively have fully public members to everything above them. We seem to like projects for organization *because they feel* like they express a stronger split than folders, but in practice they are often just fancy folders at the cost of losing a great tool of encapsulation with *internal.*
2. I may need more consideration of doing more with libraries, but it is a bummer the JavaScript ecosystem doesn't have easy encapsulation beyond private/public in tandem with file organization.
3. I wish tooling had better support for expressing encapsulation as part of the structure you browse the project with. (e.g. relationship information communicated in folder/file explorers)
4. I'm not sure what it would look and feel like when the rubber hits the road, but I really wish there were additional ways to encapsulate things based on scope/namespace; and with this , is the necessity of expressing those relationships in a useful way when navigating code.

In the end if we were better able to do these things, I think they'd allow code that is much easier to understand and navigate. Much of our cognitive load is in tracking code and figuring it out. You can make many more assumptions and reason about code in a more confident way when you know the thing you are working with is only used by one requirement as opposed to 2, 3, or N implementations."

Nowadays, getting things done do not require a lot of effort especially with the rising popularity of  cloud computing providers like AWS, Azure and GCP. I'm bored of this backend stuff and I would like to switch to a different area of software engineering but I am not completely certain of which path to follow. There are a number of options such as Security, SRE, Data Science, AR/VR, ML/AI but the factors I would like to consider are 
1. How feasible it is to go from zero to hero for someone who is willing to put in the work. This means availability of structured curriculum for potential enthusiasts either in form of a online MOOC or a real university degree (My non CS background makes me feel inadequate sometimes) 
2. Career options. I personally think the backend space is getting saturated due it's low entry bar. Also I live/work in Europe and compensation is not great.

This is all based on my humble experience reviewing 500+ resumes as Head of Engineering at a tech company:

**Shortlist your skills**

Please don't mention every technology, framework or language you've ever encountered or studied in college. Yes it might show that you're familiar with C#, Java, PHP, .NET, MySQL, Oracle, C, C++, HTML, Python, CCNA, TCP/IP, Photoshop.

But let's be real, it also shows you're a [jack of all trades and master of none](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_of_all_trades,_master_of_none). It might not be true, but it hurts you more than it helps you.

**Break down skills by proficiency**

This one is more of an advice and less of a mistake. Instead of breaking down your skills by category (e.g Databases, Frameworks, Networking ...). It's usually better to break it down by proficiency (e.g Familiar with, Experienced in ...)

Here's how it looks like in real life:

    Proficient in: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Docker
    Experienced with: Postgres, React, Git, Javascript
    Familiar with: Kubernetes, Redis, Angular, MongoDB, ElasticSearch

**Add details to experiences**

If the ""experiences"" block on your resume is basically names of companies and dates, your chances of getting your dream job just went down by 50%.

Instead try to write 3-4 sentences under each experience explaining what the project was about, how you were involved (as an individual) and some of the things you achieved on the project. If you can mention stats (optimized page response time by 30%), that's even better.

**Avoid spelling and grammar mistakes**

Why should anyone care about typos if you're applying for a technical role? Well two things:

* It shows a possible lack of attention to details. If you're gonna make typos on your resume, there is a high chance you gonna leave typos in emails, technical documentation, Slack and everything in between. There is exception to this rule as anything else in life, but it's more likely to be true than not.
* It shows a possible lack of proficiency with whatever language you're using.

What can you do about this? Besides auto-correct, use Grammarly (it's free) or have a friend review your resume before you hit send.

**Move ""Education"" block to the bottom**

This is especially true if you're applying to tech companies in Morocco or abroad. Start with your experiences (professional and personal), then move to skills and language proficiency, then finish with education. When it comes to hobbies, keep it reasonable but also original.

**Keep it visually simple**

If you're applying for a technical role, your resume can look as simple as a README on Github. But here's my [favorite resume template of all time](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/joshua-taylor-eppinettes-resume/wcsdpbkfmstz).

A good resume, first and foremost, should be easy to read, informative, interesting, typos-free then maybe visually beautiful.

And yes, your resume might stand out if it's all colorful and original, but then again, your experiences, skills and side projects should take care of that.

**Keep it to one page (Preferably)**

If you have less than 6-10 years experience. Please keep it to one page.

If you keep jumping between jobs and can't fit everything into one page, focus on the experience that are most relevant for the job role you're applying for. Also you might wanna skip some of those internships.

**Make it relevant (Preferably)**

Doesn't mean one resume per company, but also it doesn't have to be [one resume to rule them all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Ring). If you're applying to multiple job roles or companies in different industries, it might be an interesting idea to create multiple variations.

For example if you're applying to companies in banking but also a tech startup, you might want to create one resume variation where you highlight more your experience with banking software. And then another variation where you highlight more your experience at a similar tech startup."

From my perspective this is “cheating” at the interview, and this has become so common we have proceedures to follow in these situations now.

To me, someone born and raised in the United States, this is cheating and highly unethical.

This has happened most frequently with candidates from Southern Asia. We’ve has these situations arrise when interviewing people who are in Southern Asia and when interviewing people from Southern Asia who are in the US. I recognize there are many cultural differences between Asia and the US. I also recognize that even within Southern Asia there are numnerous different cultures.

It would be easy to dismiss the people who do this as immoral and unethical, but I feel like that isn’t the right aproach. There must be some cultural context that is missing from my understanding. The explanation I have heard most frequently is something along the lines of “if they can keep the job for just a month that is still a massive paycheck relative to what they may have been able to make otherwise”. That may be the case, but I have a hard time believing that is the only reason.

Does anyone have any insight they can share? My sense is there is a different definition of what is “ethical” when it comes to business."

I know so many people are struggling to find jobs at the moment and perhaps I'm lucky to still have one (at the moment)

However I've been looking to move from embedded software development into web development however I am finding very difficult to break into the field.

I did an undergrad in electrical and electronic engineering and done a year internship at an automotive company. It was my first time working on software and I enjoyed it. I did fairly well in the internship and they offered me a graduate job half way through. I went back to university completed my degree and went back. I continued working in the same team and was then in charge of leading development for a client project and became lead of the project team. Things looked fine but I wasn't happy...

There were many problems with the company and the way it operated and I could not see myself developing as a better software engineer. In addition to this my tech stack was limited to C and proprietary automotive tools. I felt like I was in a stalemate whilst my fellow grads went onto doing amazing things.

So I branched out and took the initiative to improve myself.

I've completed web development course and even created a small Todo list app and learnt the full web stack. I also worked on an Android app which used machine learning to classify images in real time as well as deploying machine learning on an FPGA embedded device . Please note here I used a lot of tutorials and help online to create these items

Currently working on developing my skills in react and flutter but got a long way to go till I ship my first webapp/app

However I know I have a very long way to go to really call myself an engineer in web development or data engineering. In order to get better in these areas I needed to gain commercial experience.

I've been applying to these jobs, it's been 6 months since I started learning and applying to different jobs. Results so far:
Over 100 applications
Failed 97 before CV stage or company never got back to me and got ghosted
2 companies had a phone interview and we're happy with proceeding but they didn't get back to me so i chased them up and they ghosted me
1 company I got to the final stage and I made clear to them that I had a weakness in object oriented programming in the first interview however I was told that don't worry I would be trained on it only then to be tested on OOP knowledge on my final interview. It was very saddening because my previous two interviews I had very positive feedback. Im still waiting to hear back but hell it was one of the worst interviews of my life.

I've applied to graduate positions too but they are looking for new grads and not my year or I failed that part of the hiring process.

So really right now I'm thinking what can I do is it a case of just keep applying or is there something I need to do more?

Almost 15 years in the industry, and yet haven't found reliable source of how to make evaluation of engineers to objectively say if they are already medium or senior or principal or whatever roles organisation has.

Different organizations have different frameworks to evaluate against. Organisations wants to be seen as transparent, fair and unbiased, thus they create this guidelines and skills required per each level.

Let me say my controversial thesis first: **it is all BS just to shut up mouths of those who wants promotion but don't deserve it (yet) according to SUBJECTIVE evaluation of manager/director/CTO.**

I personally, am in favour to evaluate people subjectively. I observe theirs maturity, code quality, problem solving skills and more. Then I compare it with very generic guidelines (to slightly adjust my opinion). 

Engineers however feels that this approach is unfair and biased, and they rise issue to management, thus management creates more detailed framework, to avoid bias. Not matter how detailed framework is, there always is place for subjectivity and interpretation. Finally, if one deserves promotion in the opinions of management, he/she will get it, because the framework will be interpreted in favor of that person. If don't deserve, they'll for sure find some ""weakness in accordance to official evaluation framework"" that he/she doesn't deserve it.

Today Agile is the default  choice for the software development life cycle (SDLC); every conference,  book, or blog post is telling us we are doomed to fail if we don’t  follow this established convention. But isn’t it surprising to think  that we should use Agile for every possible company doing software out  there? Are we going to organize software development exactly the same  way if we work for a startup, NASA, or FedEx? It seems hard to believe.

If you are already screaming *this is heresy! …p*lease  bear with me; I am not trying to send us back to the dark ages of  Waterfall. At the same time, no project or company is the same and we  should keep thinking about *Why* we do what we do. Choosing the appropriate SDLC requires a deep understanding of the dynamics of your environment.

In this blog post, I will use the lenses of risk management to help you  pick what SDLC is right for you. We will first look at how to put your software development lifecycle into context by interpreting it as a risk  map. We will then look briefly at the history of Agile and Waterfall and why these risk maps make sense in their own context. Finally, we are  going to learn how to use Cynefin and Wardley maps as tools to better  understand the uniqueness of your risk territory, so you can pick the  software lifecycle that better suits your team or company profile.     

I hope you enjoy the journey and looking forward for your thoughts in the comments."

I’ve done some projects on the side, contributed to some non profit organisations etc.

I’m now considering a move to freelancing for full time. I’m curious what is/was your experience with different platforms for freelancing, quality of projects ( this is why I thought to post here, I’m not interesting in hacking something together but rather proper development), interaction with clients.

The reason why I am considering this change is the lack of project diversity. I want challenges. I am also attracted to the flexibility that freelancing offers.

I have an interesting problem at hand . I'm building a inventory management application for Textile manufacturing business .  
Now I have almost 5000 items for which I need to track the quantity .  
Currently , I am processing them in real time when the user requests them , which was running fine when I was running in dev , but moving to production my 5$ droplets takes quite a bit of time to process it.  


So this is the usual workflow of processing the inventory - &gt;

1. Get all the transactions associated with the required item
2. Traverse them and calculate the balance qty
3. Return qty.

The transactions are the movements of the item made by the user.

Now the problem is that the transactions will increase exponentially with time , so at a later stage the above flow would take a heck lot of time to compute.   
So what would be a better approach for this?  


Currently I'm thinking of keeping a one to one mapping of the item &amp; the quantity which updates when ever a transaction is made , so that when the user requests, it would be instant .   


Any thoughts &amp; suggestions would be much appreciated.  
Thanks!"

My name's Christian, and I'd like to share what we've been building at [OrgStack](https://orgstack.io/).  I'm posting this here as a ""request for feedback"" from the community that we serve.

Poor data quality is a costly problem for many organizations.  Invalid data is responsible for major product/service outages, and it can be very  difficult to pinpoint the root cause of data-related incidents.  This requires a large investment of engineering resources.

OrgStack aims to streamline the process of managing data sources, receiving critical alerts, and tracing incidents to their source.  While building a solution to this problem, we drew inspiration from some of our favorite tools, including NPM, Loggly, and Jenkins.

A few baseline questions:

* Is data validation / data quality currently a problem for you?
* How do you solve it now?
* Which differentiating features would get you to switch?
* What would your ideal solution look like?

Thanks in advance for your feedback.  We really appreciate it!

Nobody cares what you think about anything that's not related to programming. Period—ah shit that's probably offensive, I mean Full Stop.

Not a single solitary racist's mind will be changed because of what you're doing. This can only have one effect: non-racists will get pissed because you're creating work for them, and racists will get pissed because you're creating a race issue where there was none and they will become even more entrenched in their viewpoints. You've failed to think through the consequences of your actions even a little bit.

How many tens of thousands of man hours—oops, I mean non-gender-conforming-person hours—will be wasted so you can finally feel good about yourselves? How many scripts assume a master branch and will have to be changed? How many workflows is the master branch baked into? How many millions of people will have to re-train their muscle memory—shit, that's offensive because of toxic masculinity...uh, body-positive memory—to cater to your whims?

The answer to all of these questions is a Whole Fucking Lot. Sadly, the damage here is largely done. Before this, there were maybe half a dozen people on the planet that ever looked at ""master branch"" and made a slavery connection. Now every programmer will. Forever.

I was gifted with the opportunity to build out our Projects department and design the structure that Projects are managed in at my company.


Some time later, I got the chance to dip my toe into Powershell and it just clicked. I took on any opportunity to script that I could. Now I understand that programming languages are a bit different from Powershell, but scripting just makes sense to me, I'm hoping programming languages are similar. 


To get to the point, I'm interested in switching careers. Right now I want to get into software engineering/development, but eventually I'd like to make my way into some sort of Machine Learning role. From my understanding, strong software engineering experience is essential to getting into a Machine Learning Engineer position. I do not have any sort of degree at all, but from what I can gather, it is possible to get into software engineering/development without a degree so long as you know what you're doing. So I started looking into Programming/Software bootcamps (Lighthouse Labs, Hackreactor, Turing). These are not cheap bootcamps. I am not opposed to going back to college if necessary. I just want to know the best path to get into this career field. I know that this is what I want to do. 



My questions are:



What do employers look for in a Software Engineering candidate specifically? 


What languages should I focus on? 


Are bootcamps worth the time/money?

If so:

Which bootcamps are the most respected?
Which bootcamps would you recommend? 
In addition to bootcamps, what other resources would be worth investigating? 


If not:

What alternatives would you recommend? 
Would an online Bachelors in CS be worth the time and money for these goals? (I already have a full time job in IT, so online is my only option. WGU is the first that comes to mind.)
Is this a field that respects a CS degree from WGU?

My main job is developing a parser for a specific type of PDF document. For the most part the documents have the same general content and structure (as they are legally required to follow a certain standard), but because the documents are often written by people, formatting tends to vary wildly and there are many idiosyncrasies I must accommodate. 

My current approach has been creating very complex and long regex patterns, sometimes entire arrays of regex patterns all attempting to parse the same piece of data. Often there is a method dedicated to parsing each individual piece of data, which tries multiple patterns, often in a specific order, and through a variety of logical gymnastics eventually finds the right piece of data for most documents. 

Whenever parsing fails for a certain piece of data for a certain document, that becomes a new bug fix ticket. Most of the time adapting to a new format for a piece of data is just a matter of appending a new regex pattern to an existing long pattern or an array of patterns. On a regular basis, do some QA with new documents, create tickets, add patterns. It’s very efficient now, and maintenance is fairly simple, but the code is getting out of hand. 

This is all done in a very barebones ruby/Sinatra app. Currently the text is broken up into semantic chunks, and there is a class dedicated to parsing each chunk. Some classes are fairly simple and the regex patterns can fit within the class without creating too much of a mess. For others however, I’ve had to move hundreds of lines of regex patterns into their own class to be imported into the parser class, just to keep the code clean and avoid needing to scroll past 200 lines of regex constants just to find the first method. 

I know this problem is only going to get worse, and I imagine I’m not the first person to develop a complicated, niche parser, so I’m wondering if there is a better way to do this or any existing conventions regarding complex parsing. This solution I came to on my own, with little to no guidance, and now that this task is a huge part of my job I want to know if I’m going about it in a sane way. 

Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"

AEM Development is sooo slow and the CMS instance gets ""corrupted"" every once in a while and you have to solve it or reinstall it and it's just so pointless. 

Sometimes building and installing your solution takes ages even if it's one line of code. Sometimes you can use AEM's ""crx"" tool to introduce your files manually into the CMS... I don't know who thought that pattern --or whatever that is-- was a good idea.


AEM never works, that's my main complain. You spend more time trying to get the CMS to do what you want, than actually making the code change you need to make. It's frustrating.


I don't get it. Development times would be so much better with other technologies. Why do companies would want to use AEM?

In the past, I worked for a company that grew way too fast in the last 20 years.There are layers upon layers of horrible spaghetti and nothing gets done anymore because SW complexity is higher than devs can cope with. Each developer writes an average of 1 LOC per month. Sure, LOC isn't a good metric, but 1 LOC per month is a symptom of a big problem.

While I was there, I tried to push away tasks that required adding complexity while I focused on improving the rot. This was not welcome, so I quickly found another job and left. Took me a year to go in and out and by the time I left I felt depressed. Spending a whole month trying to understand a problem in order to fix properly and repeating this over and over again is a recipe for burnout.
To this day, I feel developers there are undergoing abuse. Sure, no one is beating them up or forcing them to be there, but this is the only employer in the area and many of them have lives and families there. The only alternative is taking a massive pay cut.

Here is a quick example of how ""bugs"" are ""fixed"" in this company. One day there is a production crash on a nullptr member access:

```
void func(Object* obj)
{
    obj-&gt;method();
}
```
When the crash happens, some junior developer will try to trace down what happened exactly here so that we can fix the problem at the source. Then some ""senior"" developer will push something like

```
void func(Object* obj)
{
    if (obj != nullptr)
        obj-&gt;method();
}
```
and call it a day.

Anyhow, years of this kind of ""fix"" has made it impossible to develop new business, but management keeps pushing new features. 

We have a 3 month notice in this company, so after I gave mine I decided to disobey orders and start doing what I always thought should be done: fixing technical debt.

Next week we'll cover the Priority Queue ADT and Heaps.

- binary heaps
- indexed binary heaps
- binomial heaps
- fibonnaci heaps
- pairing heap

In the world of Software Engineering this is a horrible trait to have in my opinion. Just the simple act of initializing a new project is a bombardment of new information. Installing the libraries associated with a project is another assault. In my experience, attempting to absorb too much information on a new topic leads to very little being retained.

At a high level such actions are really simple, you're issuing a command to create files for a skeleton project and then you're asking a tool to fetch and install the libraries that are listed in a file. However, rather than focusing on the commands and the high level concepts my brain panics and begins to look at the files generated for the project, or the libraries being installed and what they do. Keep in mind at this point the project is just a skeleton and I haven't even used the framework yet.

Is there anything I can do to improve my ability to focus on relevant information and keep the right perspective rather than sweating the details?"

For the last couple of months, I'm struggling with some internal questions regarding my coding standards and approach to solving problems. 

A couple of months ago I left my previous job as FullStack+DevOps at a multinational company. I left as I felt there wasn't that much room to grow, and most of the things that I was doing felt like a routine, I didn't feel that I was challenged anymore, this was my first job as a full-time developer, I worked part-time for 5 years.

I got a job at a startup, to see how things work on the other side, as I was expecting the team is really nice and I love the atmosphere at the office, I got the job as it looked interesting and challenging(new architecture, different language: go), all the buzz words that you hear now on what things should look like.

I wrote a couple of cli tools in go a couple of years ago while in uni, so the language isn't new for me and I also have a lot of experience working with static type languages, my colleague(we are 2 working on the backend) on the other hand comes from PHP world, 15+ years of experience.

Ok, so now that I presented the context a bit I will present the problems that I'm really frustrated about.

Exactly after I switched to the startup I missed having access to high-quality peers, which I can do technical sparing with, in my previous job, if I had a problem that nobody from the team had a proper answer, there was someone in the building who had experience with that and they could give some advice.

 How to solve this while working with a small group of people? (I started asking questions on different slack/discord servers &amp; stack exchange)

When I started the code-base was full of copy-pasting, there was no use of interfaces(dependency injection wasn't a thing), the code was full of error swallowing(still is to some extent), composition was used everywhere, close to none use of design patterns(and when it was used half-implemented), global variables everywhere, a lot of the stuff is done in a dynamic way(i guess it's because of PHP mindset), the code wasn't written in an idiomatic way. After I started doing some feature development and seeing the codebase, I talked with my colleague regarding the state of the codebase we both agree that this was a problem and I spent 50%, maybe more, of my time refactoring. 

I started building abstraction over the core functionality that was used across the services, remove redundant/duplicated code, make the pipeline more maintainable(changes are required less often?), define things in a single place. When I started doing the changes I started to use go features, and use the statically typed functionality to get the errors as soon as possible(compile-time when possible), fail if the environment is configured, and so on. This of course broke some things, and I fixed them as they would pup up, we have good code coverage so that helped during refactoring. But things pop up now and then where they were working before and not after my refactor, I always get from the feeling while discussing with my colleague ""why do we do it this way, as the old way was working"", I tried to shift the coding style to something that is more normal for statically typed languages, I also tend to write more defensive code, and I always try to fail as fast as possible, I never got a feeling that this was a welcomed/understood. At my previous job, we had huge technical debt, and debugging was horrible, so I know what is the pitfall of ""just make it work""(or at least I think I do).

A lot of times when I code review or discus about design thing I feel like I am talking as a senior, I tend to do a lot of research before I do things as I don't have as much experience in web development, and sometimes I see what bad decisions were made during development. When doing sparing I can't really talk about patterns or coding principles, a lot of times when I do code review it feels like the code was copy-pasted from stack overflow, it wasn't once when I asked about something and I got the answer ""I got this from a blog post"". There are a couple of things that I can't really spar about as they sound like magic.

The main problem that I get from this is that I don't trust that my mistakes are caught during code review. Since I started here my coding standards have got lower as I got to a point where I say fuck this, I haven't written it not my problem, the sad part is that when I do code review sometimes if it's not a big issue I do the same not to point out all the mistakes.

I am learning new things, as I wanted when I left my previous job, but everything is from research online, there are very few things that I got from the team.

I've never doubted my coding decision before, but I'm starting to do that. It's not like I haven't had bad ideas before, but I always got an explanation of why that is bad while sparing with my team-mates, here I don't really get a clear answer. Both here and at my previous job I got really good feedback regarding my approach and my skills so I don't think I'm imagining these problems.

I want to know if other people experienced something like this and what was the approach taken?

Is this usual for startups?

Am I too anal about coding principles?

Am I overthinking it or do I have a bad approach?"

One of the financial analysts I work with asked what secrets software engineers use for remote collaborative work.  While I run two open source projects on GitHub, FluentMigrator and RazorLight, I don't think those experiences are the best examples to give him.

One thing that does spring to mind is Conway's Law.  Probably the best example I can think of as it applies to Conway's Law is the cultures of Pluralsight and Uber.  Uber built an entire user interface design pattern called the RIB around what it felt would optimize for the best rollout of features in its apps and improve code quality.  Pluralsight based its learning intensive culture around the concept of Mob Programming where five programmers at once huddle around a keyboard, use a massive HDTV sized computer monitor, and think of the best approach to code something.  However, not being in either of these cultures disables me from writing about some of the salient aspects.  I could conjecture how it applies to Conway's Law, but it would seem like a farcical or fake story.

Does anyone know of great blog posts explaining how Conway's Law applied to some software architecture they built?"

It's almost like my brain abstracts away certain bits of information as predefined truth so that I can focus on reasoning on more complex issues, yet by doing so it bites me in the ass further down the line.

This is a vague post but I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar issue and if so, were you able to solve it? "

Hello!

Just a little background about myself and the company I am working on: I am a Developer on Digital Agency where we primarily build websites using various CMS. We are relatively small, around \~25 people, composed of managers, designers and a handful of developers.

I'd been working for them for &gt;3 years now, it was smooth and I enjoy the work-life balance. I was primarily assigned (or getting my projects and tasks) for/from **project manager ""A""**. I never had an issue working with project manager A. He has some general knowledge on how to use the CMS we use for our products. I am also aware that there are client requests that didn't have to reach me because he can answer or even resolve them by himself. Unfortunately, project manager A has resigned.

That's when things started to become rowdy on my end. I started getting my tasks from **project manager B**. She is non-technical, nor she is even trying to be technical.

* She obviously didn't even try to learn how to use any of the CMS we use for our main product. There are basic tasks she would ask you to do in the middle of the day while you are focused doing on your scheduled tasks. She would also try to squeeze in these basic tasks every time you would be in a meeting with her.
* She would regularly and simply forward the client's email to me and ask me to ""see what's needed to be done"".
* She keeps telling me she has no idea what the client is saying/asking every time a client sends her an email. Why doesn't she just simply discuss the details to the client? instead of putting me in a meeting with her and we start guessing what the client wants? Isn't getting the details from the client is what the project manager do?

I tried to search on the internet if non-technical Project Manager is normal, and I found this article: [https://www.projectmanagement.com/blog-post/21179/Should-a-Project-Manager-have-Technical-Skills-in-the-Area-they-are-Managing-](https://www.projectmanagement.com/blog-post/21179/Should-a-Project-Manager-have-Technical-Skills-in-the-Area-they-are-Managing-)

The article justifies or even promotes that Project Managers should not have the technical skill, which I quote:

&gt;The biggest problem a project manager with a technical skill can have is the inability to let go of their technical background and move onto managing the project. At some point in their careers, to be successful, they must make the decision to become full time project managers and leave behind their technical background. If they don’t they will do neither job well.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not understand how it works. If a Project Manager doesn't have the technical skill, how are they even discussing the project with the client?

I'm not sure if that's how it really is, maybe I just got pampered by the previous project manager because he has some sort of technical background. But I don't see my status improving on as the newly hired project managers don't sound any technical too.

And the approach of our new Digital Director where ""everything is a team, don't leave anyone behind, check with your project manager first before going home"" is giving me more work compared to before where I can simply leave the office after 5 pm because no one is going to message you 5 mins before 5 pm and asks you questions on what to reply to the client.

Is this how your agency/company works too? Any advice? Are my assumptions about Project Managers wrong?

I have an offer from XXXXXXXX in LXXXXXX starting in September this year as an associate application developer (Java) which is good. However I am feeling sick of it because of imposter syndrome simply because of the fact that they didn't ask me to do any code at all during the assessment centre. They asked me about Agile and version control but nothing to do with Java.

This is concerning as I have just completed a Masters conversion course of software development, hence, no real java skills atm (apart from learning them at University)

The other thing that's putting me off is the fact because this is the XXX (CXXX) the salary is a bit low (as experienced in my case 24K at band 6G level) sidenote: what would be the salary after one year anyone know of that?

So in addition to my day job I do some development for fun at home. What used to be a high end gaming rig has become a server for my whole house. The production copies of the applications I've made get deployed there. It's this deployment model that I want to improve.

Currently, the way it works is this:

1) I build the production artifact of the application
2) I copy it to an artifacts directory on the server.
3) Adjacent to that directory is a docker-compose file. It has ALL of my configurations in it, one giant file.
4) Adjacent to it are my individual docker files, if the deployment needs one. All of the dockerfiles for all my projects are here.
5) I then use docker compose commands to do all build and deploy operations.

Here is why I don't like this:

1) all the manual steps. Copy the artifact, stop the app, build it, redeploy, etc.
2) the centralized deployment configs. All my deployment configs are separate from the app repositories and are in my deployment repo. This just makes it easier to work with docker-compose, I've tried splitting into multiple compose files but it can get weird.

At my day job we use PCF, which has a nice CLI for pushing and deploying to our environments. I've also been interested in learning kubernetes. These solutions may be a bit overkill for what I need, but I'm willing to look at them.

My ultimate goal is to get a solution for deployment that is far more elegant than what I have now (ie, pushing to deploy similar to how PCF works, configs living in individual repos in manifest type files, etc). I'm not looking for anything too crazy, ie I don't need to build a whole jenkins CI/CD pipeline for my personal projects.

While the script may not contain any PII, the CSV does. I'm wondering where people are storing these and making them easily accessible by the script that may be checked into version control.

Here are some ideas I've been pondering:

1. put it in into an AWS S3 bucket 
2. for CSV in Google Drive, craft a client (maybe there already is one), and read it from there into the script

Searching for other ideas and answers... thank you all in advance!"

to the point to afford a Tesla and I wanted to post the transcript of an episode that is not live yet, in which, you could find some guiding advice or at least get to know an interesting story in the IT world.**

**Career of Greg, who runs an IT recruiting agency, defied the odds and made great money to afford a Tesla Model Y.**

**How did your career start out?**

My career started out. I would say post college. So I got a degree in genetic biology from Purdue University in Indiana, and then moved myself paid 2008 I'm going to go do genetic research and just make my name for myself in the industry. 2000 was a bad year. Ended up working in the restaurant industry, kind of living paycheck to paycheck, did that for, six or seven years after college and basically wasted my college degree. Never had more than $10,000 in my bank account at any time. And pretty much would just go to work, make enough cash money and then go out to the bars or hang out with friends and drink and just party for the most part. So some points I'd say in my mid late 20s, about five years ago, so I'm 34, I decided to change my career and move into the it recruiting and staffing industry. And essentially, the last five years, the success and growth in my career from that has kind of progressed and yielded the ability to afford a Tesla.

**Why did you decide to get into recruiting?**

There's no reason in the world anybody would ever get into the recruiting world. And first of all, I knew nothing about it before I did. And if you talk to any of the recruiters for the most part, they don't either and they just kind of stumbled into it. So literally one day, a friend of mine from college was on the same floor as me in our dorm at Purdue sent me a message on Facebook and said, Hey, I know we haven't talked in like 10 years, but if I recall correctly, you're great with people who want to come work for me at my company. And I said, Sure, it's about time to change things up, maybe make some more money. And sure enough, I accepted an offer at it as a technical recruiter and an IT staffing agency. And I didn't even know what I was doing when I accepted it and that's kind of how I ended up in the IT.

**How much time did it take to learn into your job as a recruiter?**

So it was relatively quick. I joined a small company, and that small company, there was no training programme in place or nothing that was very robust. So it's kind of trial by fire sink or swim. I basically figured it out or I was gonna, you know, not make it. And I did. I was very successful very quick. Fortunately, the person that sent me that message got me into it was it was a great mentor. He did help when I needed it. But I'd say the time it took for, you know, stage one. So being successful, there was three to six months, which I think is pretty quick for that industry.

**How did you recruit your first client?**

In recruiting, the learning curve, I think is vast, especially with no training. And I think one of the first positions I worked on in technical recruiting was a Java developer, software engineer. And I came to learn that it's a very sought after skill set very difficult to recruit a full time candidate that doesn't need sponsorship to work in the United States. And I was not prepped for that I had no idea. I put together a statement. And searched I think on monster, and had thousands of results. And I kept looking at all these resumes. I'm like, why are all these resumes, like an Indian name for the first name, and then the last single initial for the last name, and no one cared to share with me a little bit about that there are a lot of these spoof or generic resumes that flood the databases to get to people to call and then there's a whole ecosystem of of candidates that you can recruit from, but they're not the types that I needed. And it took it took me like a week to understand that I was looking at fake resumes. And I was tired of it. I was like, I don't know what the heck I'm doing. I'm never gonna be successful. You know, they gave me the hardest skill set to work on the first time. So after a week, I finally get to the end of about 1000 results. And I say it was the last page of these results, but it probably was. I don't think it really was, was it was a guy by the name John and I won't say last name. And John, I got in touch with them. He was my first placement we got him in. He got hired right away and it was a quick and tough to learn victory for me.

**What do you do now?**

I run a staffing agency.

**How did you become a CEO?**

This started about just under a year ago. So I essentially graduated through the ranks. I started as I mentioned before, as a technical recruiter. So recruiting in the IT field, quickly found success and moved my way up to a Senior Technical recruiter, and then transitioned from, recruiting candidates on one side of the table , to account executive which is just the sales side of recruiting but now you're selling and finding clients for recruiting. So I went from recruiter, senior recruiter to account executive to CEO in five years.

**What is something that you learned in this five years on how can one can get promoted, for example, the fastest way possible?**

One is we are creatures of complacency. And we typically do not want to change our ways of life unless we're forced to. So that means we don't really proactively change things that might be changing unless we're kind of cornered and we have no choice but to you know, people stay in bad relationships. They stay at really bad jobs they live in in specific situations that aren't really conducive to a healthy lifestyle. And we'll stay in those bad scenarios. And typically not make a change unless we're forced to react, meaning you know, it's a life or death situation or you're truly treated like crap at a job and you find the said enough, enough, and then you make that change. If there's anything you could practice, I would be being proactive in the situation. So instead of just accepting things where they aren't being complacent, if you're not happy with your job, if you're not happy with the relationship, or whatever the case may be, make the change proactively instead of waiting for it to force you to make a change.

One other lesson I learned and something that truly got me actually two things that got me to where I am today. Back before I made the change from kind of being I would say, I'll use air quotes here a “loser"" in the restaurant staffing industry, not saying that anybody else in the industry are losers, but I was one word or words of wisdom that really resonated a friend of mine, Dave said to me one day is like, ""Greg, think about the five closest people you surround yourself with, and their attributes and kind of their drives and passions and successes and energy or, or so on. You're a combination of basically those five closest people"" and I kind of laughed at him at the point I said, Okay, whatever. And then I really thought about that. And truly I kind of mimics a lot of the same aspects as everybody around me. And at some point, I made an active effort to change that. And I started surrounding myself with a few other people that were more successful, definitely more passionately driven about the career and that I think it's actually what sent me down the path to change everything in those five years. And the other thing is, if you're contemplating leaving your company, or just contemplating doing a business on your own, 99% of people have these great ideas of how to run a business to start a business and be successful, but nobody ever actually pulles the trigger to do it. And I encourage you, if you think you have a great idea, there's no reason not to just today make that decision to go out and do it. Everybody just has the idea and then never pulls the trigger.

**There are two quotes that comes to my mind. One is from Asia, “The best time to plant a tree was five years ago"", referring to the action that you should have taken five years ago. And the second part of the quote is that ""the second best time is now"" and now. Regarding the five people, there's a quote I found from Jim Rohn that goes “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with”. Was there any ah-ha moment or realisation that helped you in these five years to  pivot and get to the CEO level?**

Yes, absolutely. Tying back in to the concept of that I discussed earlier, of being proactive or being forced to react. And as I mentioned, us as humans, creatures, complacency typically don't make those changes until we're forced into a corner and say, and that's enough. That's actually how I ended up where I was today and more of how I understood why that's important to address. So I was complacent. I definitely only made changes when forced to react, and I didn't really acknowledge it at the time. But fortunately, I was at a company where they're a great company, great management. I'm not belittling them in any way, but I definitely wasn't happy there and I felt like the management was just really restricting my creativity and just made me feel not valued. So it really bothered me. Even though I put up with that for a certain amount of time, there was one day where I live in Chicago and have to take public transportation to work. And occasionally terrible stuff, some people jump in front of trains or get hit by trains, and it will completely cripple your commute to work and basically makes it impossible for some people to get to work. So that happened one day unfortunate. And my boss called me or actually, I finally got into the office, and I got yelled at and ridiculed because I was late, and I tried to explain the circumstances. And it was ""I was just like, you know what, that's enough. I'm not working here anymore"". And I quit. And then that transitioned me to my next career phase. And at that point, I made that I had that realisation that I only reacted and made a change later than I should have, when I could have proactively taken approach to change earlier.

**Can you share a funny resume or CV that came across your desk?**

I could think of 1000 examples. Once, a relative sent me his resume and reached out because he knew that I do staffing and recruiting and I have a lot of experience with resume writing. And his parents suggested, he graduated from or actually didn't even go to college. His parents suggested get a job get out of the house. You're an adult, you know, move on. So he's thinking himself well, how do I create a resume? Let's reach out to Greg. So the resume he sent me. Oh gosh, it was the worst thing I've ever seen in my entire life. It it basically said one of the passions, were watching baseball. I'm like, you don't need to put that on a resume. And the formatting was wrong, the grammar was a mess. Everything you could think of you don't want to do in a resume, was on there. And I looked at that, and I just laughed. And then, I spent about an hour on it. Recrafted it and he got a job right after that.

**It's a quite tricky for someone who has never been active in the job market to create or update their CV. Can you give some brief pointers for someone who is just looking to land a job in IT?**

Yeah, absolutely. And that's actually something I host webinars and volunteer to do in a lot of different organisations. Giving those tips and helping people I would say I call it search engine optimise the resume. A lot of people don't realise that on my side of the table as a recruiter, when I was a recruiter, or even just recruiters, generally, companies, they don't realise what goes into finding you as a, you know, candidate. And so the main thing is understanding the optimization of your resume for search algorithms. And essentially, if you want two tips, one tip is truly think of the buzzwords that are appealing to your industry. For example, if you're a software engineer, and you work with Angular react and the front end for frameworks, those are very appealing to a lot of clients right now. So if you have any remote experiences that you don't have on your resume, it is essential to add it to your LinkedIn profile and to your resume wherever it's posted. So that when recruiters are searching and finding you and they're using that search parameter, Angular, you're going to pop up in the results. So make sure you're including all those really attractive buzzwords for your industry. Tip two would be definitely, you know, make the resume look relatively aesthetically pleasing to the eye. A lot of people I hate to say this do juxtapose a lot of different job descriptions, and so on, by copy pasting from other people's profiles. If you're going to do that, and there's nothing wrong with it, as long as it accurately depicts what you're doing, please take the time to make sure that the font size and everything are the same, because otherwise we looked at data like oh, gosh, this guy didn't take the time to change it.

**If you had to start your career again, let's say after university with the goal to afford a Tesla, what would you do?**

If I could have all the knowledge that I've gained at this point in my life at 34 years of age, and could I go back and graduate college and do things differently, it would ultimately be, to truly apply yourself in an area that you think you have a passion and learn the ins and outs of that. And then pursue and educate and just refine those skills. And then more importantly, understand that you don't have to work for the you know, the man or work for another company to be successful. It would be take all the skills that you've acquired over those couple of years of learning a new industry post-college, and then be creative and be an entrepreneur and turn that into your own company. Anybody can do it, and most people are terrified of doing it, but the reality to start a new company with the skills that you have, it's very simple. And people kind of stop themselves with the starting line just because they think there's a lot that goes into it, but it's not. So I would take all the stuff that I had from 14 years or so, since college, go back graduate college, and I would join a company that I think I'd be, you know, that I thought I had a passion in. It probably wouldn't have been the staffing industry because I knew nothing about it. I would soak up all the skills and information that your mentors, your boss, the company, the industry, your clients, we all give you. Take all that in and then become an expert of all facets of it. And then once I have all the information instead of working for somebody that tells you what to do and makes you feel like you realise that they're making more money than you because of your work. Then I would take the information leave, start my own company and be the top guy in the food chain.

This is my first career job straight after college. I've been given a probation of 6 months but due to my 'unprofessional' ways, it got extended to 9 not 6 months.

This is my last month of probation, I've weekly sync ups with my manager because I've been threading thin ice for some while (poor performance due to me sleeping in all the time, especially with the whole work from home thing).

I understand many of you will say that I should stay for at least 18 months and make sure I've made a sizable contribution before I leave, but it just feels like the reason why I'm sleeping in all the time is because I'm not motivated (not enjoying) by what I do.

Have any of you went through a similar phase to shed some light on this situation?

I started thinking about how this very young man has truly made it in the tech industry but I often hear about how a lot of these CS people often do make 6 figure salaries but also live in 6 figure cities so essentially they are still living fairly average lives because their expenses cancel out their income in many ways.

Do you guys feel like the only true way to make it now a days is to develop something new? Because I feel like I can speak for many of us- our first few projects were small apps or websites, but how relevant is that at all when we are one out of a million people doing the same thing?

Surely a lot of people have similar capabilities so I just find it very stressful to think that this industry will soon have an imbalance of high salary professionals, and all the other positions will be lower income because of the vast variety of people entering the tech field.

I read tons of papers regarding RESTful. Main takeaways for the purpose of this post are:
- use proper http verbs
- use nouns in uri, not verbs

However, more often then not, in my projects I'm finding that using a verb (RPC-like) POST operations fits more naturally (e.g. /api/subscriptions/123/renew ).

""Renew"" is clearly a verb. But would it make any difference if I change it to POST ""/api/subscriptions/123/renewal-requestes""? At the end of a day I don't want GET operation on getting ""renewal-requests"", not even plan to keep storing them in DB and as an entity (it would add complexity to domain models and DB).

I'm advocating - in contradiction to community majority - that pure RESTful API isn't worth it in real life scenarios.

1. Cheap. There will be no revenue from this, so I don't want to spend a ton of money on it.

3. Works with docker. I've got everything dockerized, so that's easy enough. Alternatively, if they have their own container solution that's easy enough to work with, that would be cool too.

Let's say that in the future my social network has ten millions of registered users (I know, I know, but for the sake of my question let's assume that this happens) and an average of 20,000 chats open between users at the same time 24/7.

I heard that the ME\*N stack is meant for these kind of use cases (real-time applications with thousands of concurrent connections), but I already developed around 25% of my app in Django + Postgres and I get discouraged to think that I will probably have to re-do everything again from scratch. But on the other hand, I heard that some other big websites such as Instagram have been developed using Django, so I don't know what to think.

I'm aware that it's possible to connect Django with MongoDB, but I still have the problem with managing the big amount of concurrent real-time connections... Plus, I will use React heavily on the front-end and it might be easier to couple it with Node than with Django.

Hi there!

For almost two years I've been working in a small company (less than 15). Our development team consists of only two people (including me) while in the past it consisted of 4/5 people.

Previously to this job I worked at a start-up where I did learn a lot (Vue, .NET WebAPI 2, MVC) but had to switch jobs because the payment was very low / working very hard.

From my colleague it came to my knowledge that apparently we are almost as productive / doing the same lifting of work as the previous team. This translates into having to deal with a lot of responsibilities and sometimes a lot of pressure because they expect us to work hard (since we have shown we can be very productive).

To be honest the payment is average / slight above average but it feels like I'm becoming an all-rounder. I have to work with ASP webforms, WCF webservices, SharePoint, doing IT admin tasks, answering phone calls with customers in case of bugs and maintaining a monolithic code base.

It feels like my previous skills are rotting away and now 'learning' technologies that could be build more efficiently and be better maintainable (and enjoyable).

Sad part is they expect you being a full-stack developer + SharePoint developer + IT admin + customer service. My goal was to specialise in new and enjoyable web frameworks (re-active) + specialise in REST back-ends / .Net core.

I hear a lot that it's better to specialise in something than to know something about a lot of stuff.

I have tried to make my point clear and they have allowed me to make a basic WebAPI setup and transfer little parts of our software to MVC. Though most of the time we are busy with maintaining the old legacy code base.

And furthermore we have to work on machines that are 10 years old (Core 2 duo) which in itself is sometimes frustrating because the machines are too old / slow to have a decent working experience.

Am I being too hard for this company or are they indeed expecting too much?"

Hi everyone, I'm pretty sure this is the right place to post this, but forgive me if not.

***TL;DR -*** I have not found a lot of information out there regarding MBT and am led to believe it is little more than an academic pipe dream; am I right in saying this?

For context, I'm doing doing my master's thesis on performance testing and Agile software development. The goal of my research is to find tools and techniques to make performance testing more palatable to your everyday Agile practitioner.

As part of this project, I just wrapped up a systematic literature review related to performance testing and came across a lot of papers saying MBT solves a bunch of NFR testing issues like time, load, complexity, yadda yadda. Before doing this SLR I only had peripheral knowledge of MBT, as in, I knew it existed and had a semi-firm grasp on the concept, but I never implemented it at work or in any project I've been on.

I started to get suspicious because the literature wants to imply MBT-type approaches to performance testing offer better coverage, less complexity, and less cost than traditional performance testing (i.e., load testing, JMeter scripts, etc.). So I figured my next paper would be comparing MBT efficacy against ""traditional"" testing methods and reporting the results; because I'm fairly certain MBT isn't the savior the current literature hints at.

Like I said, I didn't know much about MBT, and because most the stuff I read about it recently was related to performance testing, I figured that's what it's for. But a cursory google search reveals almost all academic sources, no ""here's how to do model-based performance testing on your projects"" types of guides, which makes me think it doesn't yet exist outside of research publications.

So I googled MBT without the performance connotation and did a little better, but it still seems like the concept isn't quite as fleshed out for actual use, or it's just not a very popular approach. Some of my top results from queries like ""model based testing in \[programming language\]"" revealed things like Git repositories that haven't been updated in almost a decade, or applications that have very sparse documentation.

One promising piece of software is GraphWalker, and there's some interesting stuff about it out there. But having *one* promising piece of software for an entire testing paradigm leads me to think that either **a**: I am misunderstanding what MBT is and am actually already doing it everyday, **b**: my googling skills are rusty, or **c**: MBT just isn't all it's cracked up to be.

So finally, my question is, does model based testing exist outside of academia? Have you seen it used in a professional setting (like in business, not research)? Am I misunderstanding what MBT is?"

I work on a team of 3 developers, myself included.  I'm the official Technical Lead of the team, so I'm primarily responsible for helping design and lead implementation of projects.  My manager is an Engineering Manager, so he is expected to have some level of technical depth and contribute a small bit of code each sprint.  He and I have gotten along very well for the past 6 months, but have reached an impasse on the current project, which is mainly decoupling our domain from a large service.  The implementation details of the project were agreed on at the start of the project a month ago.  We're about halfway through now, and he's become involved in code reviews.  One review really concerned him, because it was dealing with migrating ""trash code"" (selecting particular elements out of a list of data, or adding elements to the list if a condition is met) as he called it.  I had a number of meetings in one on one settings with him to explain, again, why we were taking the approach we are.  However, none of the meetings made any headway, and he is now insisting and arguing with me in front of the entire team that we are doing this wrong, and his approach is the only way it will work.  I have tried a couple of times to work through his proposed approach on my own, and each time have run into roadblocks.  So, the project has grinded to a halt until we can reach agreement.  I even went so far as to create branches of trying his method, and branches showing line by line how my method works and showing how quickly it can be done.  I then have had discussions with him, trying to go through the different branches of code to show I did fairly consider his idea, and proved it was technically more difficult than my approach.  But, I can never make it through the entire code discussion because he cuts me off and says he's worried the project won't work if we go my way, without offering any actual explanation other than fear of my approach.  I do have an upcoming meeting with our mutual boss, so hopefully that will resolve some of this, but I am just baffled at the whole situation.  Has anyone had to deal with a similar situation, and how did you either convince the other person to go along with you, or come around to changing your mind?  I've been in this industry for 7 years, and just have no idea how to handle this."

I also start to question how we do things. One iteration in our work goes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

As a student of computer engineering this is going to be a final year project, I am relatively sufficient in Java (degree level so beginner in the grand scheme of things), and will have a mentor/project coordinator to guide me. I am very new to anything that is not Java and this project is designed to be challenging,  it has also been agreed with the coordinator that a commercially viable software tool is good to do.

&amp;#x200B;

As a beginner I am aware that to get data from Amazon there are 3 APIs available, and there is also the option to scrape data, which apparently requires IP rotation as Amazon does not like it (and may be a route my coordinator does not allow). I am hoping that someone could provide some general advice on a couple of areas.

  
1)What data can I get from using an Amazon API? Where can I find some beginner friendly resources on this?

&amp;#x200B;

2) How valid is my statement about Amazon not liking software scraping from their site? Are there any ways to do this that are deemed acceptable? I am just getting the data that can be read off the screen by anyone - just on a large scale.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Is there any scope for a beginner to consider making their own API if the APIs provided by Amazon do not give the information I need? I want all the text off the listing, this is bullet points, main listing body, reviews, title.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Can any more general advice be given to help a beginner on their way? Any other methods on how to achieve the goal? I have my meeting with the coordinator in 6 days really trying to nail down a good project idea.

Also, maybe some female software engineers can give me some insight into how it is being a female in the industry. The oil industry is definitely a “good ole boy” industry which makes it very difficult for women to advance in technical roles (they mainly switch to sales, admin, hr, etc.) and I’d prefer to stay in technical roles.

* Will I get a chance to learn some handy tools I can use?
* How would I be able to cope with order cancellations where I have to pay back?
* What can I do to attract some customers who want to place an order? For instance, what ads should I look at to find a rough estimate on the price of the order?
* Did any of you folks did this before? If yes, how was, or is it?
* What do you think of some platforms that let you establish freelance work? One example is Fiverr from Israel.

Original thread has gotten pretty popular over at https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/glz7rn/aws_tutorials_by_an_exaws_engineer_interested/ so thought I'd share here too.

I worked at AWS as a software engineer for a few years. I've noticed some interesting things since leaving:

* People who want to deploy websites/apps/pages are really, really daunted by AWS.
* Trying to find AWS tutorials online is just awful. It feels like everything is either a manual, a ""12 hour certification course"" or an outdated Medium article from 2016. 
* Many people are using Netlify, which is really just a wrapper around AWS, and similar ""instantly deploy services"".

I've recently helped some friends in the startup world set things up on AWS - mostly deploying static sites. So far, all of them are now 

* spending less money on hosting
* getting better load time on their sites
* deploying things pretty much as quickly as Netlify's offering

I'm planning to write up some friendly resources/tutorials on using AWS so others can have these benefits too.

Would you guys be interested in this? 

If so, **please let me know what kind of tutorial you'd like to see.** It'll help me decide on the best tutorials to start with. For example, it could be ""deploying a static site on S3 + CloudFront"".

**It would also be a huge help if you could answer in this form I setup earlier: https://forms.gle/SFTuigCBeupeReV2A.**

**In addition to helping me decide which content is best to start with, it'll give me a way to distribute tutorials I create to you guys.**

Hey everyone, I'm just looking for some general advice for my situation.

I graduated from college recently and I've been struggling to find a software engineering job in my area, and the pandemic is making this harder. After the pandemic, a recession will probably happen, so should I go back to school and get a Master's in Software Engineering given the situation? 

I recently moved back to my hometown due to a death in my family and I want to stay in my hometown for the foreseeable future. I have very few connections in the area for networking and I wouldn't classify the city I live in as a tech city, but there are definitely jobs and industries in the area.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and I've come to realize that I'm far more interested in creating and designing software much more than most theoretical topics in Computer Science, so I don't think pursuing a Master's in Computer Science is right for me.  I have some experience working for smaller companies as a software engineer, but no more than two years of experience.

Given my circumstance, would going back to school locally for software engineering help me make more connections in the area I'm in and boost my chances of getting a job? Is it more valuable to go back to school to get a Master's rather than job hunting during/directly after the pandemic?  

Also, I understand that having a degree in Computer Science and some work experience qualifies me for at least a few software engineering jobs, but I'm ultimately wondering if the additional schooling is worth my time and money for making connections, boosting my skillset and expertise, and having more on my resume during an employment gap, especially given the job market and the state of the economy.

Alternatively, instead of going back to school, I was considering just working on projects for a professional portfolio and applying for jobs in my area as they become available again. I'd like to network too, but I can't do that in person at the moment due to the whole pandemic.

I'm trying to weigh my options and see what the best choice is; any advice is appreciated."

I am currently targeting an AWS EC2 instance as a deployment environment, and while I don't currently have plans to deploy the same instance of my API application to many servers, I would like to design my application so that is possible in the future.

I have a search operation that I currently have implemented using a Trie. I am thinking that it would be slow to rebuild the trie every time I need to perform the search operation, so I would like to keep it in memory and insert into it as the search domain grows. I know that if I only wanted to have one server, I could just implement the trie structure as a singleton and dependency inject it. If I do this in a potentially distributed application, though, I would be opening myself up to data consistency issues.

My thought was to implement the trie in another service and deploy it separately and make requests to it (this sounds like micro service concepts, but I have no experience with those). Is this common practice? Is there a better solution for maintaining persistent data structures in this way?

Any advice would be appreciated. I am a recent college graduate and the company I work at uses only one sever for all their deployed monolithic applications, so I am hoping to learn as much as I can about this on my own time

so i am totally new to this (30yo). very excited to making a change of career in this direction. my brother gifted me a ruby course on Udemy, just started.

so i am a bit of a lazy person. struggle with the discipline of putting in the legwork of making my dreams and plans a reality. I will plan to, perhaps put in 8 hours of Udemy course per week and only do 1.

I have recently been chatting with a friend from a self-development program i participate in (landmark) and he has suggested something that has worked for him well around issues like this:

he suggested committing to a date for landing a job in the field. then putting in some milestone goals along the way, all with specific dates. I would like to give this approach a go.

my current plan was to finish the Udemy course on Ruby, embark on a few projects that have application in real world with user interaction/feedback, learn pieces of additional languages required for those projects, start applying for jobs.

if you feel this would be a suitable approach, how many hours do you think it would take to achieve this?

there are a fair few posts our there about how long it takes to get a job from scratch. It seems to vary a lot depending on how much time put into learning. It would be nice if i had a rough estimate of how many hours it will take to get to point of realistically applying for job, so i can pick an end date, work backwards to see how many hours per week i will need to put in etc.

thanks for any advice

As far as nonfunctional requirements go, they only want a ""user friendly GUI"", and have nothing specific in mind. Are there other points of reference we can use? Such as, for example, some kind of standard or convention?

I can't write ""The system shall have a user-friendly GUI."" but if I write something like ""The search input field shall have a width of 20 characters.""

There are multiple scenarios where we copy over the same thing over and again (example commands).  I really liked Windows 10's Clipboard History (Win+C shortcut) where it saves most recent clips which you have copied.

After shifting to Mac and Linux, I constantly felt the need for such feature/application. So I made one in electron so that I can use it on any operating systems.  Install the application on your OS, start copying. Most recent 20 clips will be shown in ***System Tray*** or Press shortcut ***Ctrl+L***(For Win and Linux) ***Cmd+L***(For Mac) to open a window, where you can navigate through your copied clips using mouse or up/down keyboard arrow keys.

Select the clip which you want by pressing enter or mouse click.  Necessity made me built this :-)

They bashed me and planted things in my head like “there’s no jobs for that”, “you wont have a consistent job” “they will remove you once you hit a certain age. They only keep young people”.

Also. I have a HP pavilion laptop, but I got it like 5 almost going to be 6 years old. It’s slow as hell and it can be a pain to use since it freezes here.  I was thinking of getting a MacBook Air? Is that a good laptop to use to code &amp; use it in the future once I’m out in the field? Since I know they give discounts for students this time around.

The work is fun and exciting but sometimes I'm traveling for a month and working 70-80+ hour weeks while out there. The onsite environment can be miserable. Hot plant in the middle of no where getting covered in dust/grime from just being out there.   


I was looking at transferring to a more traditional software role but I have some concerns.    


1. My current skills may not transfer well and while I had the skills in college I will need to do a deep refresh to be competent. 
2. From a friend in the industry, it seems that a lot of software engineering is constantly working as a team effort and pairing up to write even simple code. I don't mind working in teams but I like being able to put my head down and grind through a complicated problem and come up for air when I need to ask a question or take a break. 
3. I'm worried I might find it boring. One of the great things about my current job is seeing a design start to finish and knowing that when you walk away that line or robot cell you programmed will still be running a decade from now.   


&amp;#x200B;

My current company is a small business so I also assist the systems admin with maintaining/upgrading our current infrastructure. I find this work interesting and enjoy working with the physical hardware but systems admin looking online the pay seems pretty low compared to software engineering. 

  
Is there a career that mixes the two and is comparable pay to software engineering?"

I am a full time bar manager by vocation, but at home I am a P.C. builder enthusiast of 10+ years, digital illustrator and full time learner. 

At the outset let me say, I don't believe in a college degree. I absolutely do not want to snub anyone who arrived in that way, but for me personally, I have more confidence in my own ability to learn independently than to spend 50k-100k on an education . It has been stated across multiple industries that employers do not concern themselves with a degree if you are a vital asset to their field (obviously with exclusions, doctors, lawyers etc.) 

With my experience as an illustrator and graphic designer I know that coding skills are a must. What I'm asking is the following... 

1. How do I begin to develop this skill and where do I start?
2. What resources are available online to begin?
3. What are the core skills that need to be mastered before moving on to employment?
4. What would you have done differently in your career from when you started to where you are now?

If I sound impatient, it's because I've got 10,000 hours to get under my belt. 

Thanks in advance!

I’m new to programming, but have basic knowledge of html, CSS, python, and Javascript. I’m looking to expand on that with this project, but also am open to other tools.

A bit more info:
- One database is an accounting program, and the other is time card data. The accounting program had everything but realtime timecard data.
- The default reports that are built in to both programs aren’t that good, but I’m also looking at this as an opportunity to expand my portfolio as a developer.
- The data for the dashboard would come from many different tables within each database.
- I’d like to build a real time dashboard for project managers. This would have stuff like number of leads, dollars estimated, quotes sent, costs vs. budgets of current projects, etc. Maybe some pie and bar charts.
- A nice bonus would be the ability to “drill in” to reports for more information. For example if you wanted to know how the “number of leads” metric was generated, you could double click on it and it would show you the list of jobs included in the count.
- The ability to print the dashboard and generate PDFs of it would be a nice touch.
- Only LAN access would be necessary; remotely accessing the data would be too tricky.
- This needs to be a cost effective option. I’m willing to do more developing if it means paying less.

We've been asked to do test automation on our internal data-driven UI and set goals to drive our work. Majority of the changes a user can make are through the way charts are presented. The data team does QA of the data that's feeding the UI but we're responsible for what the UI does when presenting that data.

The company that acquired us is very metric and automation driven. They're requiring  us to do test automation, and in this goal cycle want us to define some leadership goals that are metric-based that they can use to track our work against. Up until know we've been primarily doing manual QA, but now they want to gauge our work through automation.

We have a repository with a little Selenium UI automation that uses our development environment but it seems as though it's only useful for regression testing. We're thinking about expanding on that but are there any sort of metric-based goals for UI test automation?

Some other topics that have been brought up are performance and uptime, but I'm fairly confident the engineering team is already tracking uptime through a logging tool. Also, I don't know if either of those fit under the umbrella of SDET work or if we'd be venturing outside of our domain by touching on such topics.

Any ideas at all are welcome. It seems they're leaving it up to us to define what should be automate and the metric-based goals we'll use to track that. Unfortunately, they're not providing any guidance. I fear that if we don't come up with something that this may be the end of the road for us."

Create some mobile app and place the ads there as well. Join some start-up or start your own. Invest money in some real-estate or the stock market. To put it shortly you have a lot of ways.

Also, it's known that small efforts in a long period will bring much better results than the big efforts in a small period of time. For example, it's more efficient work on your app an hour daily for 7 months than 7 hours daily for one week. Unless you are in a hurry to get something done.

I believe that moving yourself away from Netflix or some computer game for a small period of time and focus on some perspective could bring you a lot of results including financials.

TLDR; I am considering a career change from product management to software engineering. Has anyone done this, or switched from a marketing or tech lead role back to engineer? How did it go? 

I’ve worked on the “business” or customer side of technology for a bit over 10 years.

I tinkered with HTML and JS a bit in my teens and after doing other stuff for a few years I was lucky enough to land a business analyst gig. 

It allowed me to get close to software development projects early in my career which really piqued my interest. 

So I went back to uni and studied software engineering and marketing while I worked. 

Since then I’ve worked as a “Technical” Product Manager in varying forms (Internal Systems, API’s, SaaS and consumer facing) for some pretty big websites (30k average DAU).

The thing I love about product is being able to identify problems or opportunities and formulate ideas on how to solve for them. 

I’ve always continued to do some coding. Either on the side (python mostly) or as part of some prototyping or demo stuff at work. Partly to keep my mind fresh but mostly because I enjoy making stuff work. 

The kinds of products I work on are data-focused and relatively interesting in both system design, data flow and scale (concurrent users etc.). 

That’s the kind of software engineering I am interested in as well. 

I am keenly aware that tinkering with things isn’t the same as doing it as a job (And I really don’t want this to come across as some snotty PM undervaluing devs - I refuse to work anywhere engineers aren’t seen as my peers).

But, I am confident I would be able to learn enough of the latest .net or python data processing standards within a couple of months to be able to ship some features. 

The best engineers I have worked with are bordering on being product managers anyway. They care immensely for the customer and value simplicity over complexity every time. 

What I don’t enjoy about PM is the ego and politics that is inherent at certain levels, the perception of value we add to an organisation when really we could just use a metric value to decide whether or not pursue an opportunity and just how little time I have to _think_! 

I just want to work with a team, learn, solve problems and avoid the stress that comes with the above. 

So, has anyone done this or something similar? If you were in a position where you could make this shift, knowing some engineering leaders who would give you a crack at an entry level gig - would you do it? 

Thanks for reading and I look forward to your replies.

I see that many people advise starting with web developer as the entry point in this field as a self-taught developer and later move into other fields like gaming, AI, Cloud computing. 

Thanks in advance."

we are a group of business administration and engineering students from the university of Ghent tasked with creating a hypothetical enterprise. Our idea is to develop a mobile app that makes paying by way of a bank terminal easier and safer for people with visual impairment. The app would work as follows: when the user presses his/her phone against the terminal, the amount due would be transferred through NFC to the user's phone. This amount would then be read (through headphones) to the user via Text-to-Speech. After the user confirms the amount, the app would redirect to the user's preferred banking app and the purchase would be complete.

As we do not possess enough knowledge about app development to assess if this would be possible (let alone implement this ourselves), we chose to outsource this. Given the current crisis however, few companies have time to help out students right now. Which we completely understand.

So our question is: would something like this be possible? And if yes, what would be a good estimate for the cost of development? Thanks in advance!"

&amp;#x200B;

I am the sole developer, infra, and ops guy on an on-prem platform (atleast 16 services for a 2 node configuration), I asked the project manager for me to be shifted to this last year (specifically, October, documented through emails, chats and calls on teams)  


&amp;#x200B;

I lay out the required effort on tasks for the project manager, like a spreadsheet with columns for tasks, effort (in man days) and status (whether, started, reworked, stopped, etc) and commitID/Issue# so they can be aware of what I am doing at any given time.  


&amp;#x200B;

Now, before I was even assigned for this project, they've committed to the client to deliver this in 1 month. They just told me now. The presentation I made October last year suggests that this project could take atleast 4 months due to rework on APIs and well me being the only one working on it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, PM wants me to construct a timeline, because she ""will never fall for that MAN DAYS thing again..."", but I politely declined to commit when (I might get fired but not sure if they can rework the committed date, as I've said I am the only one who knows this app back and forth, it atleast needs 3 people to replace me. I sound like a douche but I am confident that they won't be able to find anyone with my skillset in 6 months).

&amp;#x200B;

They keep telling me, ""we will need to focus on this part first"", where we == me. Which I also politely declined because it wont add any benefit (just getting me doing busy work). Backstory is: there were performance issues on the previous version of the app which made the app unusable, and in my opinion changing one component is not going to guarantee that it will be fixed.  


As an example, changing how the authentication mechanism won't solve a primary storage issue. that is how disjointed/incoherent their opinions are on this.

My main underlying goal in life is to be as self supporting and sufficient as I can, and I want to do that in a way that fits my strengths. I’m a person who is really good at taking projects and optimizing them, extracting data, analyzing, and more. Do you think I’d be able to learn the skills necessary to become a Software Engineer like within the next 4-5 years? And what major should I take- Computer Science? Software Engineering? Etc.? Also, if someone could explain exactly what Software Engineers/Developers do? Or maybe a Systems Analyst would be better?"

Hi there, 

I'm wanting to know what skills I should request a software dev have to be able to have the best possible chance of building out the system I'm looking for. 

The goal of the system that we're wanting to build is to have a camera watch a ship and calculate the stress/strain on wires as the elements they attach to (mast/boom etc) are moving. 

For example, a sail ship has a number of guy-wires attaching to the mast/boom and other areas. As the boom moves from side to side, the guy-wires will have different stress/strains placed upon them. A specific boom position means that specific guy-wires will have certain amounts of stress/strain on them. So essentially, we need the lengths and Young's modulus' of the guy-wires, booms, mast and other objects on the ship pre-programmed in and have the stress/strain of these objects calculated in real-time during the dynamic movement of the ship. 

Two questions arise: 

i) What skill sets would the programmer need to have in order to be able to build out such a system? I'm guessing potentially mechanical engineering mixed with software and potentially even an animator? But also, what languages? 

This would need to be packaged into software that can run on a smart phone/tablet for real-time use, ii) what programs would such software need to be originally written in?"

I am looking to build a video chatroom app where users can create / join private chat rooms, and I would appreciate some advice on how to go about storing the chat data. Whenever a new user joins the room, they should receive a history of all the previous chat messages, as well as the list of current users.

On average, I expect chat rooms to be destroyed (ie. everyone has left the room) within a few hours of their creation. Thus, most of the data that needs to be stored is very temporary. On the other hand, messages in the chat will probably be somewhat frequent, and the data will be updated often. What would be a good approach to storing this data?

I've considered a few possibilities:

* Since the room will support video calling in addition to textual chat, I considered implementing the textual part of the chat with the WebRTC data channels, since the clients will already need to create WebRTC connections for video. Then I would only need a server for signaling (it would still need to store the list of rooms and users in each room), and the message history could simply be stored at every peer? When a new user joins the room, they could just get the message history from one of the peers. But in this case, I wonder if it's possible to end up in a scenario where (due to disconnects, etc.) no single peer has the full message history?
* Storing the the data in some in-memory data structure on the server side. Or perhaps using some in-memory database such as Redis?
* Using a traditional / NoSQL database where data is stored on a disk drive. I would prefer to use NoSQL in this case, what would be some good options?"

I'm obsessed with this thought of high quality maintainable code, and I want to be able to write this myself.

I think this stems from the fact that I was drastically unimpressed with the code quality at my new job and it was truly a big slap in the face for me. I had extremely high hopes that everything was going to be tested, documented, and written properly, but lol boy was I wrong.

I've read the book *Clean Code* and take those principles to heart, and I am currently working through *Working Effectively with Legacy Code*, however this wasn't exactly the book I was looking for I've come to realize. I'm about halfway through and it seems the underlying goal of the book is to teach the reader how to get existing code bases under test so that refactorings can take place, ultimately increasing the maintainability of the code as time goes on.

I think this is the knowledge that I am missing and that I want to focus on. Do y'all have any advice on what knowledge software engineers should know?

I work for a midsized SaaS company as an embedded and thought I’d share what we are really looking for! 
* **SQL**: For some reason, this is a huge hole. 90% of DS is data cleaning and manipulation. Don't just know the syntax; know how to manipulate raw product tables to get the data you want, and be able to defend your pulls to business line owners and stakeholders when they ask why you're showing them what you're showing them.  
* **Logic and self deduction skills**: I'm not just talking about math-like logic. This includes business and interpersonal logic as well. For example, why is this person asking this? What is the “whole board” they’re seeing?
* **Ability to check your data and findings against the product output / business situation**: How do you know what you pulled is right? That your findings make sense? Do your numbers hold water against someone who knows the product data and inter-workings inside and out? Can you explain your models?
* **Non technical stakeholder communication skills**: This includes presentations, building rapport and relationships, managing up, managing different attitudes, understanding perspectives, understanding how to ask questions and listen between the lines, building strong daily partnerships
* **Business strategy skills**: Now that you’ve completed this project, now what? What does this mean for the business? How do you see the whole board and make a recommendation that fits in? 
* **Grit and attitude**: AKA the ability to wrangle through messy problem,  messy data, and with messy relationships and politics. Know how to get through the mess, how to self problem solve, and when to call in favors. Also, have a willingness to do grunt work, like write SQL, or figure out what the product data is, how it is produced, and wtf the engineers were thinking when they structured the product in that way.
* **Politicking and relationship building**: understand how to work with product, biz line owners, execs, etc to solve problems. Have a strong willingness to HELP OTHERS! 
* **Tableau / data viz in some way**: be able to clearly relay your findings, with ""like I'm 5"" attitude, to people who are not comfortable with even basic bar charts or graphs. You should be able to look at a graph at a glance and consume what it is telling you. 

Then... python/R, special packages, math, modeling, etc. 

I see so many people worried about x language or Y package, where I actually think those are relatively easy to learn. The soft skills aren’t taught in school and are VERY important - and the hardest to find! 

Honestly, analysts and data scientists don't get to do the cool stuff all the time. There is a lot of boring stuff that is easy to do, technically. I built a dashboard the other day that took me maybe 4-6 hours from start (coding) to finish, and people falling over themselves in excitement. It wasn't fancy, but it made it VERY easy for them to get what they needed, quickly. 

What do other hiring managers think?

**ADDITONS:**
* When all else is equal, we hire based on culture and team fit, and willingness to learn. **Attitude and fit often outweigh technical skills!**

* The requisite mastery level certainly does depend on the job level. For more junior level candidates, I understand when you haven’t developed those yet... but how is your attitude? Do you think you know everything bc you have the hard skills down? Or do you recognize that you are just starting out and the soft skills are what you need to learn? 

You’d be surprised at how many people graduate with a MS or PhD, but have no work experience, and think they deserve senior level roles. Sorry... drop the ego, you only know a little bit of what you actually need to know to be successful. 

* Re: how to convey this in an interview / resume, or how to ask interview questions - you ask performance based questions. “Tell me about a time you partnered with a non technical stakeholder to solve a business problem”. 

Talk about how you solved the business problem first, then about the tools you used to get there. I like hearing about cool stuff, but I also need to know you can do the basic stuff and the soft skills REALLY well. 

* We hire for a well rounded team. Everyone has a different background. Not everyone is going to know everything. That is ok. Lean on what you're good at, have an attitude that focuses on continuous learning, and be a strong team player."

For example let’s say I need to combine data from 5 different datasets, not big data, but large datasets of maybe 4000 rows.

Let’s say I need to get county data for death rates, illness rates, education rates, internet access, and income for a report I need to make. I would use a county code to bring the data together with excel formulas. It’s work great so far, with no complaints from anyone, but I wonder if the process could improve, or if I should even bother to improve it."

I come from a more statistical background but I was in BME before that and I just can’t see it. 

Yea I understand Python has scikit and Tensorflow/Keras. Scikit is easier than for example caret in R. And Keras makes DL easy too. 

However, for any general data analysis and manipulation Python feels way harder. Before even doing a linear regression I have to know wtf a “class” object is and how it works. I don’t think in terms of classes and OOP at all. I think more mathematically. (I did get used to this part of Python now but it took longer and I am still not good with making my own class) 

Compare that to R where literally on day 1 of using it I can figure out how to use lm() and glm(). I don’t need to know any OOP. 

Then pandas is another hellhole. The whole .loc and .iloc differences and indexing becomes annoying. Can’t figure out how to nest the dataframe easily by a group so that I can resample within a group for every group type thing and when I look it up I get a bunch of solutions pointing to using dictionary and iterators etc. In R I could use group_by() with nest() and then use map() or lapply(). 

Oh also and then if you do a=b in python it doesn’t create a copy but its some pointer. In R I can do this without worry with no idea what a pointer even is. While Python there is some no.copy() or copy.deepcopy() you have to use. 

Without CS knowledge R is FAR FAR easier. I can literally get right into the analysis without learning all this overhead about data structures and class objects. Data manipulation is so easy with dplyr and purrr and the % &amp;gt; %

Then to get interactions and everything within a design matrix in Python I have to use patsy so that I can do the R-like formula syntax. 

Maybe for unstructured data like images/NLP and deep learning Python might be better but all the data I deal with is tabular. For unstructured data you need some CS knowledge anyways. But for a typical beginner I just can’t see how Python is any easier to do data analysis or manipulation in. Especially if you want to focus on understanding the math/stat concepts."

I analyzed my local restaurants based on how common and popular they were with the foursquare api. Then i graphed the geospatial data with folium on a Chloropleth map based on housing prices i got from Zillow. I’ve seen whole medium blog posts/ reddit posts about how these blogs are worthless since they’re just linear regression which is a bit disheartening.

I think I have the experience and the knowledge to move on to a entry level data engineer position or data science. At the very least a higher paying data analysis role with less management. I had to manage study recruitment, advertising, contacting participants, setting up appointments, IRB submissions, training creation, and the actual training most recently due to a lack of proper budgeting. On top of concurrent data analysis for multiple on going studies that still needed to be done. My job stress has been mounting for a while now where I’m the person where things get dumped that others don’t have time for. 

I just feel over worked and under appreciated. I’m over working myself by studying DS on weekends. My silver lining is that I heard back from IBM for an entry level data science role in my areas. I’m so nervous about my first data science interview. I’m not very confident about some things but I hope that they think I’m worth putting in the energy to train and develop . If not I’ll just have to keep growing as a professional and as a developer.

(TLDR at bottom)

&amp;#x200B;

Is going into a data science diploma program from a bootcamp like Brainstation the right decision?

&amp;#x200B;

My background is in business; I finished my **B. Comm in Supply Chain Management** this year and got interested in data science as my program had built-in 2 courses on data science. Learnt a lot about data mining, science, stuff like Bayes Theorem, kNN, etc despite not getting too much coding experience in it as we used analytics software. However, the whole concept of actually using the potential of big data to derive insights for companies, and optimize their operations got me really interested in a career in business-oriented data scientist. Also have a background in stats through my program.

&amp;#x200B;

My work experiences include my internship at a **Fortune500** healthcare supplies company, where I was tasked on doing data analysis on inventory and sales. At this point, I understood that Advanced Excel can only take you so far in data analytics. My other work-related experience was my capstone project with **Walmart Inc**. This involved performing a **data mining project** in regards to their eCommerce fulfillment (can't disclose much more due to NDA).

I really want to hone in on data science, and plan on using it in-tandem with my business knowledge to help firms learn and optimize their business processes. I have been searching through the sub, YouTube, Quoram and whatever source and experience I can find on the viability of a boot camp as a legitimate way to get into the field. I found that a good amount of people are **advising against data science boot camps** (and boot camps in general) as companies and Hiring Managers always prioritize candidates who have a degree in mathematics or CS, rather than a boot camp.

Would someone like me, who is really interested in a data science career and coming from a business background realistically be able to start a DS career from a boot camp?

Is the viability of  bootcamps really that bad? Or is this simply the case of comparing career prospects of students who have only done a degree in CS, engineering, math, etc. vs. someone who doesn't have a degree and only did a bootcamp? This was an impression I got from some of the articles and videos that I read up on. I totally understand a degree is more comprehensive, but will it fit my background as I already have a degree (albeit not in CS/eng/math) or will I need to get a degree in STEM as well?

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, most of the master programs for the current year have already filled, and I will have to wait another year atleast to get enrolled into one of the masters program. I don't want to wait that long, and rather start a boot camp soon and get working experience as a DS sooner rather than being later. Waiting it out would put my career in an awkward position :/

&amp;#x200B;

This has been bothering me for a while, and I thank you for hearing me out :)Any advice or experience from you guys will be really valuable, and will help me out a ton.

**TLDR**: finished my B.comm in supply chain. Have some informal work xp as a data scientist. Want to be business-oriented data scientist. Wondering if its actually worth doing a data science diploma from Brainstation as some people have said that most companies tend not to look at boot camp graduates."

Semi long text incoming but I'm feeling pretty lost and could really use some guidance/insight.

I'm currently 32, been working as a Tableau and Alteryx consultant for about 6 months after a job history in IT (last job was consultant/Windows SysAdmin for hire)

I'm fascinated by ML and I've been trying to get into the field but I'm not seeing a path forward. 

I've got no PhD, masters or bs (only something called a Propedeuse which means that you've completed all of the 1 years courses) and I thought I would/could make it with a decent portfolio and GitHub. As a first step
I landed this job after a Business Analytics program that took 6 months and covered BA, some light statistics and DS but nothing major.
I've got a decent skillset in Python and SQL due to my history in IT.

I've set myself challenges to complete some DS projects like the the Titanic set and house pricing set from Kaggle and I'm currently working through O'Reilly's Hands-On ML but I'm getting the feeling that I'm putting a lot of time and effort into something without being efficient or without it ever culminating into something. I love working on the projects, understanding the methods and completing them but I'm not looking for a hobby; I'm looking for a career path.

Most job listings are really looking for a degree and starting that track at my age, with a full time job and 2 small children is going to be challenging and really time consuming (at least 4 years to complete a bachelor's degree). 

But with all of this, I just need to know; what path should I follow? Keep plugging at Kaggle, get back to school or just...take my leave and find peace with hobbying?

edit : Thanks for all the responses everyone, this got way bigger then I expected it to be!
I think it boils down to the fact that ""homeschooling"" isn't going to get me further and/or faster then every other freshly graduated student with a bs or ms or phd.

For now I think that the best course would be to focus on my Alteryx and Tableau work (mainly Alteryx b/c to be honest, the design aspect of Tableau just isn't my cup of tea), save up for the tuition fees and start working on a degree when I'm established at work and not caring for a baby anymore. The degree, and what it stands for, might just be the only realistic way of getting on the same level.

I want to build my portfolio in hopes of moving into a more formal Data Science role. To achieve this, I plan to develop a series of projects in Kaggle, build out an inventory of tools to share on Git. I also plan to find new ways to implement ML or DL concepts in my present work using existing raw data, potentially including image data. 

 In my work, we work closely with a GIS team who curates our department’s geospatial data in ArcGIS. I am developing proficiency in Esri tools. 

 At this time, I am weighing the value of doubling down on filling gaps in my math education vs. developing stronger skills in Python/R/SQL. Or both on a longer timeline.

 How valuable is it to use time to address this skill-gap? Taking college-level courses in calculus, multi-variable calculus, linear algebra and discrete math for example will take many years. 

 Realistically, I am at the beginning of this journey. I have a bachelors with a major in Anthropology with some focus in Archaeology, but I do not have a strong background in analytics. Although I can work through data science concepts and use data science tools on the computer, I suspect mathematical education to be a major hurdle. 

 I’m open to suggestions and know that any strong path forward will take a few years. I’m prepared to do the work but need to find the best way to optimize my time. 

 I am not opposed to doing master’s work, but I want to make sure my ducks are in a row and find the right program. Here are some details about my current credentials:

\-  Bachelors in Anthropology with a focus in Archaeology 

\-  Three years’ employment in a Grant Manager/Digital Resource Manager role in Nonprofit

\-  Current one years’ employment in a Data Analyst role in Gov’t

\-  Developing proficiency in Special Data Science

o  Took Esri’s Spatial Data Science MOOC

 Is Data Science a realistic path forward? Is there another disciple that might make more sense to pursue that would better capitalize on my skills, like Geoanalytics? Should I prioritize math or computer learning?

So currently I am working as a data scientist and started studying again on top.
Apparently, I have total chaos at home now regarding hardware.

Company guidelines allow me to do testing and prototyping on private hardware (which I do, as I have it available and it is way faster than asking IT for Ressources every time).

Currently I have a small Xeon server running Ubuntu with docker and a jupyter server, a private workstation laptop (heavy and clumsy), an powerful windows desktop, a Mac mini by my company, a laptop by my company, and an private iPad Pro („laptop replacement“).

The result is total chaos. Data of my private projects gets cluttered everywhere, I sometimes hook up laptops to docking stations even if I would need the power of the desktop as I don’t want to waste time setting up virtual Python environments over and over again, and so on.

And I feel like it’s becoming more and more of a problem as my work and studying evolves. Sometimes I just need to setup an entire new Hadoop or Spark System for testing or a few databases or whatever.

So I am thinking about what to do. I thought about upgrading my server and only rely on the server and a thin and light „dumb terminal“-Laptop. But it would be a lot of work managing, maybe expensive, and impair my work on the go as I have to work in environments where it is often simply not possible to connect to my home VPN.

The point is basically that I overall don’t need much for the most time. Python, maybe a jupyter Notebook, and that’s it. But I often stumble on points where I just suddenly need a GPU for CUDA or a few databases or a few virtual machines. And evertime one of those needs comes up I have to move my entire work up until that point from the more mobile but weak to the more static but powerful hardware (iPad -&gt; Laptop -&gt; Desktop &lt;-&gt; Server).

Another alternative I was thinking about getting an thin and light Laptop with not much power and and an mediocre desktop at home that’s just there to have a lot of storage and connect to multiple displays. I could then maybe run every project (like a single node Spark System or Django development) in an public cloud environment like on an AWS machine. This would skip the migration step from one of my hardware pieces to another and save me a lot of time and headache.
But this implys a long term problem. It would be expensive to pay the upkeep of every single instance that’s not needed at the moment. So I would need a way to archive an entire cloud machine locally in case I need the work maybe months later again.
I have no idea if AWS or anything provided this ability or if this idea makes financially any sense at all.

So how do you handle the hardware demands for your data science (especially data engineering) needs? Where do you prototype and test for maybe personal projects and how do you treat your work to not loose anything in the long run and can reuse it?
Any experiences with the ideas I had?

Every input, suggestion or idea highly appreciated.
Thanks for reading and have a great weekend."

Hey all!

First off, I cannot believe the amount of positive feedback and sign-ups I received on my previous post. I’m honestly floored! In order to accommodate all of the sign-ups, we’re going to host three separate sessions so (almost) everyone is able to attend. Now, if you’ve already signed up, you should have received an email asking you to pick one of these sessions. FYI, it’s first come first serve.

For those who weren’t able to sign up but are still interested, there are a couple options!

1. We are going to do this monthly so you can definitely attend the next session. Use [this sign up sheet](https://forms.gle/RqZ5Hp2QmgLzoowD8) so I know to include you in the next session.
2. We are going to record a session and share it.

Also, I know I won’t be able to get to all of the questions you submitted so I’m going to work on other ways to answer all of the questions you asked. If you have any ideas, I'm all ears!

Thanks again,

I started as a Data Science Researcher at a company that had no real connected data infrastructure, then I basically volunteered to build it all and design the analytics. They made me Business Intelligence Developer reasoning that I'm more technical than an analyst but I'm not doing any data science - just building pipelines, dashboards, and recommending improvements to data architecture (there is no data architect).

At this point, I'm definitely a junior data scientist at best - I know a lot of theory but don't have a ton of experience applying concepts, and much of my work involves reporting on historical data. I have a lot of subject knowledge around social media, political science, economics, law, psychometrics, and behavioral psych - I might be considered a polymath - but my work barely scratches the surface. I'm really good at using R for packages and shiny dashboards, but not so great with python or the more advanced SQL queries. I don't even have a public git repo where I show off my code to potential recruiters. I do get paid $80+ which is nice.

My team is somewhat central to the organization's data. I'm in charge of creating requirements for most of our product data, recommending changes to product support, creating company-wide surveys, and have access to HR data. For a while, I was the go-to problem solver and de-facto team lead until a manager was hired over me - now I just seem to get tasked with dev work. Now that the data infrastructure is more or less coming together, my manager wants to use a cloud ready-tools like AWS Glue and Quicksight over establishing a real DS toolset.

I'd love to hear some advice on how to optimize my career from here. Choices seem to be to

* **Stick it out**. The challenge here is that my manager is a real barrier to job satisfaction and advancement. I have very little autonomy, and all of my strategic input is shot down via manager telephone (e.g. ""I asked and the VPs said they don't want to do that"" or ""I asked our boss and they say to not have conversations with the other team to gather requirements for your proposal to fix their data model"").
* **Move on.** The challenge here is that my work experience makes me not a perfect fit for a lot of data science jobs. there aren't many jobs that I am both qualified for, and are broad enough to let me flex. I don't have and advance degree, I'm missing some languages, no clearance, no practical AI/ML/NLP/Regression experience. I've sent out several applications with no nibbles.

I am confident I can get there, I just don't know where I should be going or what to expect. Has anyone made it through a similar situation? What should I learn or look into?"

I then switched to try to use the newer Facebook Ax library, thinking it would improve results. Unfortunately, it hasn't. In the BO python package above, there is a concept of ""Domain Reduction"", which when used with my black box function has been very successful in rapidly finding near optimal ranges for 26 parameters, some Choice and some Int/Float Range. I've linked it here:

I've been struggling to understand two things:

1. Is this somewhat already implemented (bounds tightening, domain reduction, in any sense) in the Ax project?
2. If not, what would be my best path to adding something like this within Ax?
3. Are there any better tools for my task?

I am a recent computer science graduate (I earned a master's degree). I have an undergrad in information systems. I went through college math classes like calculus, multi-variable calculus, statistics, discrete mathematics and linear algebra.

As soon as I entered the master's program in computer science, I always felt that I was missing some math in comparison to people who have had a computer science undergrad. That thought haunted me. Because of that thought, I was reviewing math during my master's and took hard math courses other computer science students didn't want to enroll in because they heard they were hard. I passed those classes, even though sometimes it was brutally hard to balance that class alongside my difference exams (which I had since I came from information systems undergrad). In short, my past 2 years of computer science master's were brutally hard, but I had the chip on my shoulder from coming from an information systems undergrad and worked extra hard to pass classes (and sometimes more than just pass).

**In the past few weeks, I had this idea that I should review math from the ground-up (start off with all the Khan Academy videos, then move towards textbooks) because I most likely have gaps in my math knowledge.** Even though I know that most computer science master's degree holders have some gaps in their math knowledge (as does anyone), this thought won't leave me. I still have that chip on my shoulder coming from an information systems undergrad and this, I think, is my impostor syndrome.

**I want to be a data scientist or a machine learning engineer - but the positions I'm after are not some research positions where I'd be developing a new algorithm.** The positions I'm after are simpler - applying BERT to new languages, for example. After I get the hang of the job, I thought of doing freelance consulting work. If during my job I encounter some material I need to brush up on (whether it's math or something else) I can review it on the fly. Even if I have to read some paper on my job, usually the formulas there are already derived and if I don't understand them, I can ask someone on my job or I can ask people on this subreddit or something similar. And let's also not forget that while I may not remember how to find derivatives of complicated functions by hand, I did have all that math through my academic education.

**What do you think, data scientists of reddit? Does it make sense for someone in my position to review math from the ground-up, or is it the impostor syndrome speaking?** I am the kind of person that is always erring on the side of discipline and hard work, so this may now be backfiring, but maybe I should execute my plan of reviewing the math or maybe I should just relax."

Plotting decision boundaries can help immensely in the model selection and hyperparameter tuning process, as it can help detect overfitting or underfitting. [Here](https://vivianrjkmr.github.io/2020/09/01/decision-boundary-visualization) is the link.

**The motivation for my post**

I noticed that many online explanations and tutorials explaining overfitting rely on 2D datasets (i.e. datasets with only two input features). Such boundaries can be easily plotted on a 2D plane, but what if your data contains six input features? One can use dimensionality reduction to plot the actual points, but what about the decision boundaries themselves? This is what my post explores.

It would be an amazing help if you could spare some time to take a look, and maybe give me some feedback. If you liked it, feel free to ""like"" my post.

Hope you find it useful and/or fun to read. Have a nice day!"

Unless you're living under a rock, you're probably aware that the US economy is hosed right now because of COVID.

I think it's important to factor this into any job search decisions because many economists are talking about a serious ongoing recession lasting at least another 1-2 years.

This is just one article I read but you can read the same elsewhere:

[https://www.axios.com/recession-within-recession-coronavirus-0bcb2af4-4c1a-4ded-9579-096214c5b2d6.html](https://www.axios.com/recession-within-recession-coronavirus-0bcb2af4-4c1a-4ded-9579-096214c5b2d6.html)

The point is if you're thinking of changing jobs to move onto something better, you might want to suck it up for awhile until things settle down. Generally, DS is in demand and high paying, but the job market is in uncertain territory for now and the near future. 

Anyway, good luck."

Certainly no computer science or engineering. I can handle basic html (think MySpace) but that’s the extent of it.

It was a bit disappointing to see that a large majority of the work done is plain wrong because people don't read the problem statement and apply common sense.

For instance, here is an interesting [dataset on heart failure](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data). You would expect people to read and understand the problem. The problem involves 2 target features - time and death\_event. The time column tells us how many days it took for death, and the death\_event tells if the person died or not. 

If you are building a model, you should not use the time column, since that is clearly not available to us during prediction on unseen data!

Alas, there are a 100+ submissions of notebooks, all touting 0.93+ AUC based on xgboost. Each one of them have a data leak because they used the time feature. Each one of them proudly display the variable importance graph and show time as the most important variable. No shit, Sherlock!

In my opinion, Kaggle is no longer a valid indicator of a person's capability as a data scientist. All you need to do is setup an sklearn pipeline and run it on all the data-sets you can find. Never mind common sense!"

Increasingly we are seeing news articles (e.g. https://voiceofaction.org/collapse-of-civilisation-is-the-most-likely-outcome-top-climate-scientists/) discussing how we are about to face major destabilizing effects on society from global warming. Let’s put aside any discussions about the accuracy of these models and the scale of the impact on society and for the purposes of this post agree that there will, at the very least, be effects, and that these effects are growing with time.

Now, management asks you the regular questions: forecast sales for next year, recommend how much product to keep in stock, propose where to establish stores, predict supply line delays, etc. In a “normal world”, we would assume business as usual and not bother about freak tropical storms impacting our East Asian manufacturing, pandemics decimating demand, or blizzards disrupting our supply lines. But if these events are becoming more frequent, ignoring them no longer remains good practice.

Another side of this topic is that climate scientists argue the “cost of doing nothing” is far larger than the cost of reforming society to become more sustainable. By leaving out the effects of climate change, we, the forecasters, are effectively predicting that the cost to our business of doing nothing is zero. Thus, our lobbying departments will lobby against any reform that would negatively impact our results under past conditions.

How can we as professionals go about to include the probability of extreme events and gradual effects of climate change in our models and forecasts? What new types of projects should we be proposing, e.g. around resilience? What can we as data scientists do to highlight the “cost of doing nothing”?"

I'm trying to build a predictive model for work. The model should predict the number of orders that'll be delayed. The data is from a production site. Delay means if the time taken to produce an order takes more than target cycle time. And there are hundreds of order in a day with different target ct and elapsed time. Now, these are the two fields I have in database, target ct and elapsed time. 
But the way I'm predicting till now is from a data that comes from a dashboard (Qlik). Qlik expression (If Elapsed time/Target CT &gt;1 then lagging flag =1, order is delayed) calculates if an order is delayed and then sum all the orders for the day. So, from qlik data, I have two columns, Date and number of delayed orders for that day. I have only tried building Arima models from the qlik data and forecasting is not accurate at all. I'm using JMP btw, since qlik data wasn't that huge.

Can you guys please tell me if I'm even towards the right direction because the Order number will change everyday so no correlation between order being delayed and order number. I'm also not able to find the factors that will cause a delay."

I noticed that even though I'm using python in both cases, it's a completely different thing.

I feel like doing data science projects is all about using methods from known libraries and assigning the new values to a new variable, and then get the output from the model.

This thought raised in my head when I was following a tutorial which suggested me to manually drop 1% quantile of a column in a dataframe to get rid of some outliers. I thought ""hey, maybe I could write some loop cycle that automatically deletes outliers in every column, given some parameters, instead of doing it manually"". Turns out some library does it already, of course. And this translates just to making a new variable and assigning the new values to it by using the apposite method that the library offers. 

Does this get any different as I go further in the subject? Maybe ML algorithms will require me to be more creative? Will I get any chance to write my own algorithms at some point? Don't get me wrong, I like it anyway, but I really enjoy being creative with algorithms too."

Hi community!

I've been asking many questions, and I do want to express my gratitude! However, I came across a thought. Is the ""Normal Distribution"" curve a universal thing or is it specific to the data you are looking at?

For example, let's take digital advertising. We have 1000s of different ads running. However, most would generate a click of 0 during their run. This would cause the distribution graph to look abnormal because of the amount of zeros there are. However, this is normal to us because it's something we've seen for years (at least at this company). So, because this has been observed so many times, would this be a ""Normal Distribution"" ?

Each of these companies, one in the marketing competitive intelligence space and the other in the supplier performance management space, features a proprietary scoring model. I'd like to learn more about developing scoring models, yet I feel it's an interdisciplinary challenge so I'm not even sure if this is the right sub to ask this question.

One of the scores primarily involves quantifying Likert scale survey responses then scaling a weighted average of the results to a 0-100 score in which 50 is the midpoint. We've faced challenges describing this score to clients because the school grading scale is ingrained in their minds, so they'll interpret a 65 as a D, which is bad, but on our scale it's actually somewhat positive.

As I work on developing the next iteration of this score, I'd like to change the scale, but I want to use sound reasoning rather than making an arbitrary decision. Are there best practices in any discipline where I could learn more about this? What are some keywords I could search to find relevant journal articles? I've found tons of literature addressing specific aspects of scoring, such as assessing its validity and reliability, but nothing that integrates all the relevant parts.

How do organizations develop scoring models that support meaningful interpretation of results? One example I've thought a lot about is the credit scoring model from 300-850. Why was this scale chosen? Why not 30-85? Why not 3000-8500 or 100-500? Is there any scientific reasoning behind this or is it really just arbitrarily choosing a methodology then marketing the scale until people learn it? Other examples I've thought about are standardized testing (ACT up to 36, SAT up to 2400), various D&amp;B scales (some 1-5, some 0-100), NFL passer rating (0-158), and even non-numeric scales like S&amp;P credit rating.

I'm under no illusions of applying to a Data Scientist position but am applying to more junior Data Analyst roles given my background and experience. 

For reference, I have 2.5 years experience managing and querying databases, manipulating that data for either reports, dashboards, and ML models, and providing 'data support' to business or scientists.

My academic background is a little different than most analysts given I have a BA and MA in History but I taught myself SQL, Python, Alteryx, and Tableau and have applied those to real world situations at work. I also spin the History degree as providing me with excellent story telling skills which is a key component of the data analysis process. This has worked for me in the past. 

Prior to that I had five years tech-support experience and 1 year database management experience at smaller companies. 

I am proficient at SQL queries, Tableau, manipulating data in either drag and drop tools (Alteryx), general Python including Pandas, Numpy, and enough Scikit-learn to run the built in models but not make my own at this point. 

I'm also working on some side projects for my portfolio including an A-Z data analysis where I scrape websites using BeautifulSoup, clean the data, run some basic stats with visuals in Numpy and Matplotlib, apply the data to a multi-linear regression model, and then create a dashboard in Tableau for additional descriptive exploration. 

I am looking at jobs around the San Francisco Bay area since I'm relatively close, it seems like that's where the jobs are, and my girlfriend can find work there as well. 

I feel like I'm doing everything right but just can't get an interview.  Is it the History degree that's holding me back or just the analytics field in general right now?  With unemployment benefits being reduced, I'm starting the feel the pinch and any help would be greatly appreciated."

In addition, I never really get to explore new methods while working on these projects. Sitting in this KDD workshop on PyTorch, I’m realizing that my skills are not keeping up with the current DS field around the world, and I can definitely say that I identify, at best, as just an average data scientist. 

With that said, I’ve decided to stop being so lazy and will start doing some learning on my own. My goal is to learn/get familiar with either some of the newer, or super complex algorithms/libraries.

I’ve created a list of algorithms/libraries that I plan on exploring on a bi-weekly basis. Week 1 will be a general introduction with basic examples, and Week 2 will be a real-world example. Obviously some will take longer than 1-2 weeks, but this is just the general idea. As I am already a DS, I’m not talking about the beginner level stuff, I am talking about the more advanced DS topics. 

For those of you that are constantly enhancing your skills, what learning plan do you follow? Any recommendations? And I do already have a long list of things to learn, but where do you find out about some of the newer, cutting edge stuff?

One final thing to note - I have access to Pluralsight, though I haven’t really explored what it has to offer. Any good courses on here?

As I understand it is a highly competitive position, one which a PhD does not necessarily guarantee a researcher position.

To help create a more appealing CV, my plan was to get a job in Data Science next year after obtaining my Honors in computer science. My manager and I have a good relationship, so I told him about my plans, and he was more than willing to put me into touch with Data Science managers to understand what they look for in a data scientist. He also told me that most positions are frozen due to the craziness going on in the world as well as that I might have to sacrifice some of my income (which I am willing to do). He also told me that we have a big data position open in our team in which I would work closely with data scientists in productionizing their ml models and help setup, maintain and optimize the distributed environment for data scientists.   


His requirement is that I stay in this position for at least 3 years which is conflicts my timeline in the sense that I would like to finish masters in two years time and then apply for PhD abroad. My guess is that the experience in the big data position would be less valued (don't know by how much) than a data science position. The upside is that I keep my income (maybe even strengthen it with this position), I don't have to take the risk of possibly not getting a job in data science and the position still aligns with my end goal.   


What do you think? Is it worth taking the risk and try landing a data science position next year or should I rather play it safe and take the position he offered and sacrifice an extra year. Please share the reason to your choice as well as this is more important to me.

I decided to pursue a PhD because I noticed that all the jobs I wanted either required or strongly encouraged a PhD. I'm 1.5 years into a PhD in computer science, which includes statistics and natural language processing. My masters thesis was in time series. Before that, I was working as an analyst without programming skills. During my masters, I did two data analyst/data science internships.


I've been trying to find a remote, part-time internship for a while now to keep my industry skills sharp and never even got to the interview stage since starting my PhD. I figured with my experience, I was perfect for an internship: I have academic experience, I have a little bit of industry experience, but I really need mentorship and guidance when dealing with practical problems.


Last week, one company emailed me back but told me that they were offering the paid internship that I'd applied to as unpaid only, and they asked me if I was interested in an interview. I figured why not, at the least it would be good interview practice. 


Horrific is maybe an exaggeration, but it was truly awful. So first of all, the company deals with image classification, which I've never done outside of classes. Maybe I was naive, but I thought that a few classes I took two years ago and my more recent experience in natural language processing might be enough to translate into an internship in image classification. I was wrong. 


I didn't realize it was going to be a technical interview. They immediately started off by asking me if I knew a certain term and to explain it. I had never even heard of it, so I'm not sure if it was a library, a concept, or a software (yes, I should have written it down but at this point, I was very flustered). This continued for maybe ten different terms. With each one, I'd never heard of it. I wish I had just cut the interview short after the first two or three since it was such an obvious mismatch. They eventually gave up and just asked me to explain what I was currently working on, and the interview ended.


I don't know where to go from here. Clearly there is a huge discrepancy between my skills and the skills that this company was expecting from someone with an undergrad or masters degree in data science/machine learning. Normally, I would find a bootcamp or some course and start up from scratch again. But I'm wondering if it would be better to focus on what I'm doing in my PhD and try to hone one or two skills. I am scared of either (a) pigeon-holing myself and not being able to find a job in those specific areas or (b) broadening my skills to the point that I don't actually know anything important about a wide variety of data science concepts.


By getting a PhD, did I ruin my chances of working in anything other than what I'm working on now? Should I focus on building up my natural language processing skills or should I start spending my evenings doing more general coursework that would be applicable to other data science areas?"

So, I'm a business graduate and I want to specialize in DS by getting into a master degree program. However, as expected, I'm not an expert on mathematics, statistics or coding (Even though, I've taken some courses on these areas, I consider myself pretty weak) 

During my studies I've got the chance to learn and work with SQL and Spss and since then, I'm thinking to do my master degree on DS.  

Recently, I've found a fairly new master programme and judging by their curriculum, it looks very promising but also, tough. Professors are expert on their department, they are working mainly with R and Python, university provides free Datacamp courses, plus students are expected to apply their skills on cloud platforms such as: Github, Tableau, Kaggle etc.

I'm looking up the post about entering data science and  mostly people who post them are either mathematicians, statistics/computer science (or other related) majors. So they have some type of prior knowledge on these and I assume it might be easier for them. But, I'm not expert in any of those areas and I don't know to what extend I should know these. (I'm bad at coding and math btw) They say that, statistics, algebra, coding, calculus, etc. is a must, when it comes to data science. However, basic coding and math skills along with learning R, Spss and Python to some degree seems enough for the most part. (At least what I understand) 

So, I don't know to what extent I should know these fields and that's what scares me. I mean, I love working with data and analyse/interpret it but, I don't know how much of my time will I spend on learning these type of concepts etc.(To what degree one should know them? Like, if I have to get into D.S. do I have to speed my time mostly on these? Or just the basics?) Thus, I can not decide if I can manage even finishing the degree or not. 

I couldn't find any comprehensive information regarding this and I'd like to get your insights, thanks in advance.

And I've spent the last 8 years working in finance at a top-tier bank in data engineer / financial analyst combinational role.

During lockdown I've completed [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/) (highly recommended for beginners) and I've now started planning for the future. With a mix of the professional and personal I'm considering (covid notwithstanding) taking a sabbatical next spring to travel and study.

Initially I thought a Master's in Data Science was the best option and had settled on applying for the [MSDS at Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/master-of-applied-data-science-umich). However this would cost $42k and with my current background I think a master's might be overkill anyway. So I'm currently considering taking a year out and aiming to finish all/most of the below in lieu of a masters:

* Two 'MicroMasters' one at [MIT](https://www.edx.org/course/probability-the-science-of-uncertainty-and-data) (heavy on the Statistics) and [UCSanDiego](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/uc-san-diegox-data-science) (heavy on Python, ML &amp; Spark) - to be clear, I'll do both - approx 1,100 hours of study and $2,750 in total.
* Several Coursera certificates: - 500 hours in total
   * [Michigan Applied DS](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) \- general overview ML, data mining.
   * [IBM Applied DS](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) \- covers ML with a Capstone project
   * [IBM AI Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer) \- ML, Apache Spark, Keras, PyTorch, TensorFlow with a Capstone project.
   * Three different courses from deeplearning.ai, which seem to extensively cover [Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?), [TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice?) and [Natural Language](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing#courses) processing.
* There's also a broad Specialization from [HSE](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml) on coursera, but at 240 hrs this looks similar to MicroMasters.
* Finally, I'll probably finish the R module on Dataquest \~30 hours

The above will likely evolve as I learn more. And I'll keep an eye out for worthwhile Kaggle projects (already finished the Titanic project).

Long-term I may wish to move away from finance entirely, maybe even back to academia. But short-term I might be best placed to attempt to pivot back to finance into a full time data science role for a few years and then decide from there.

I'd really appreciate any advice or suggestions on anything, but especially; 1. the merits of foregoing a masters over the above. 2. comments on the future plans, 3. Kaggle suggestions, 4. If there's anything on my study list that I've missed (I only learned of PyTorch 2 weeks ago when I started looking at job listings)."

What does that mean?  What is its value?  I know many struggle with this question.  Let me try to provide some clarity and thoughts by comparing to other professions.  

In this world there are many big industries: oil, energy, auto, pharmaceutical, aero, shipping, finance, etc.   just to name a few.   There are other newer businesses also usually built on marketing plans like FB.   Each specific company has different data infrastructure, business needs, and problems to solve.    Each company has to make profits.  If they are collecting or trying to collect data then they want to use it to optimize/estimate/predict and make more profits.  Data scientists build capability or products to do this.  ""Data Engineers"" do assist in the infrastructure but without the people that analyze data/extract value, data engineering wouldnt be needed.

Now we can ask the questions of who is qualified for this work and how much is a data scientist job title worth?  And is everyone now a data scientist?
Well what is a financial analyst worth,  what is an engineer worth?   Who can do those jobs? Is everyone an engineer?  It all depends on the business.    For these other professions they usually require accredited schools and some require standard certifications like PE license. At the same time, some technicians in companies end up with ""engineer"" title through experience with no accreditation.  So the qualifications depend on the job and business.  Also,  just because one is experienced in one business doesn’t mean they make a large amount of money, because their industry may be in a bad time in history.   Many professional engineers in oil industry are cut or making less today.   In finance I am sure big bankers make a whole lot more than little ones and are basically a different profession than little banks due to skill set.  But both are considered financial analysts.  One thing the other professions have learned is their industry domain expertise, with traditional skills.  Which usually analyzes data already in their jobs.  ""Data"" itself is not an industry, at least in my opinion.

Data science is even more general than these other professions.  I could find a high school student and train them to be a data scientist very cheaply and quickly on some dataset using powerBi, with little math skills.  But they won’t know much about other domains, business, profits, design, coding, and consequences of data decisions.  Most importantly they won’t have domain or business knowledge.  Which they will need in order to get a good data science job and provide value to business. They could probably find one with some small organization trying to analyze their data like at a local library or city govt.  But it won’t pay well, maybe even minimum wage.  This would be just a few steps under the large amount of people today getting a BS or just a MS without a thesis.  So the low end will be getting flooded with this type of job seeker.  This is ok since everyone with data wants to profit from it.  But due to lack of accreditation or licenses and supply/demand these jobs will be low pay, unlike engineering. 

Now many wonder how do I just get the highest paid job with the smallest amount of education in data science?  This question appears here almost multiple times a day.   The answer is hard,  one can do it with just a no thesis MS but it may not pay well.  It is a continuum, where depending on what you know, and who you know you will be qualified for various roles.  If you have a phd, highly technical, understand business problems, and have personal connections you can work at Google.  If not then it will be more difficult.  Having a traditional degree/experience like engineering or finance helps with these skills.  

Data science won’t go away but expand vastly.  Its skills include math, stats, engineering, and business skills depending on the person. It will not be taken over by analysts and software engineering but the opposite will happen in prototyping phases.  The pay and people in the field would also expand, making many lower and higher paid jobs available with vastly different skills.   It will not be a clear distribution of pay, but multi-modal,  and average pay will not mean anything due to many modes of pay.  

So in take away, if you want the best and highest paid job as a “data scientist”,  You need higher education, correct technical skills for a profitable company, understand a company/industry, and know people.   There is no easy route and as always the only path to greatness is putting in the work for years, getting out,  and networking.   And even after getting all that education, you can still end up not being valuable.  So higher ed, networking and knowing an industry, which I feel is the critical path to getting in the door at a good company and data science role."

I'm the maintainer of [miceRanger](https://github.com/farrellday/miceRanger), an R package which performs Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) with random forests. I have developed a package, miceForest, which does the same thing in Python:

* [Github](https://github.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceForest)
* [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/miceForest/)

I'm a huge fan of documentation, so I've included a very comprehensive README on the github, which explains the MICE algorithm and the details of the package.

# What is MICE?

Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) is an iterative method that allows you to fill in missing data using all of the available information in the dataset. Over a series of iterations, every column in the data set gets modeled by the other columns, and the missing values are inferred by the model. Stef Van Buuren wrote the book on missing data, which details the algorithm [here](https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/ch-introduction.html).

Random forests are a good 'chaining equation' to use because they:

1. Do not need much hyperparameter tuning
2. Easily handle non-linear relationships in the data
3. Can return OOB performance inexpensively
4. Are trivially parallelizable
5. Can return feature importance for diagnostics

# What is it used for?

I do a lot of funnel modeling at my current position, and MICE has proven invaluable. It allows us to eliminate bias in the funnel caused by missing data being 'less missing' the further up the funnel you go, which allows us to:

1. Use all available information, no matter the funnel stage
2. Create confidence intervals on our predictions. More data filled out = less imputed variance = a more confident prediction. This allows us to create more robust confidence intervals for our forecasts.

# Motivation?

I originally developed this package for R because all of the available packages were lacking in either speed or features. As I start using Python more, I noticed that the available MICE implementations do not provide the functionality I find myself using most often (custom imputation schemas, built in diagnostic plotting, imputing new data)."

I do not see my role having value/purpose outside large corporations.  If I had money to retire, I'm not sure my skillset would have any further use?

That said, I've been romanticising about data science of late and considering a transition. My logic is that the skillset has use outside big organisations as well, unlike my current skillset.

I suspect this could be a problem in perspective/framing and if I phrase things right, all will be well.  I think I see the main purpose in life to be useful and help people.  I guess I'm not sure if I'm doing either of those things?  That said I've worked in healthcare in the past and it just seemed like the same stuff, different domain, may as well get paid better, right?

Previously, I was chasing advancement in money and learning new skills.  I'm now at the top end of pay and I do not feel like I'm learning.  That said I'm part of the problem, I'm not driving myself to learn like I used to.

I doubt I'm the only person who has thought like this or raised these questions.  So for those that have considered similar, how did you answer the questions or how do you frame things so you can move forward unencumbered?

It seemed silly to go even further into data science if the field has tonnes of people stuck with no sense of purpose in their work like me."

I probably retain some bit of calculus, but realistically I doubt much beyond the basic concepts if push came to shove.

I know that life has become somewhat of a circus these last six or so months and everyone has a different hand dealt to them, with many, many people having shittier hands than me.

I am a working at a start-up as the company's only data entry/analytics engineer/data scientist/analyst/machine learning engineer/basically all things data. Prior to covid, the company had a number of other revenue streams but since covid, the data analysis arm (me) has been essentially the only part of the business that can keep making money. My boss has been great. He gave me four months of full pay maternity leave (for non-US people, this is considered amazing by US standards). We had a freelancer that I trained to do certain aspects of my job take over for me, so during my maternity leave, we had bases covered. Once my maternity leave finished, I came back to work except, I have essentially been minimally productive. I don't have anyone helping me with childcare 9-5. My partner works in construction (so not a WFH type of job) so he's not able to help out during the day.

The nature of my work (as most people here probably will know) is time consuming and requires undivided attention. Writing or debugging code requires an attention to detail that is basically impossible to keep while caring for a 6 month old full time. Now, I know what you're thinking, ""extra\_noodles, why don't you get childcare?"" well, see I would, if there was an affordable childcare option that didn't require the use of public transit. We live in a large city where most people don't have cars, so the public transit system is/has been widely used. The public transit system has been one of the leading factors in the spread of covid here so I'm not comfortable exposing my child (who, at 6 months, has essentially only the immune system which has been provided by me) to a potential covid risk. From my research, while young kids aren't considered high risk, children under one year of age are, and I can't even imagine using a daycare right now.

So here's my question to you - if I were to take time off work until child is around 1 (this would be for approximately 6 months), how shitty do you think my job prospects would be, knowing that my current job (which I've had for about two years) has me doing many many things and specializing in none? How negatively would a 6 month break be seen for a data generalist? 

* I'm decent at code (but definitely not software engineer levels)
* I'm out of practice on SQL and other DB stuff 
* I'm generally pretty good at analysis/speaking with clients about data
* I haven't worked on a team in years
* I've essentially been prototyping with NLP and CV libraries for the last year and a half
* I'm pretty good with viz using plotly, tableau, excel (lol)

I have little idea what the landscape is for DS jobs right now because I've been in full time mom mode for the last 6 months and also full on getting ready for maternity leave for a month before that, so about 7-8 months of my brain essentially being close to blah with most things DS.

OR, alternatively, if you're in a similar position as I am, what's your game plan? How are you making this work? I'm spoken to my boss and while I can use freelancers for a lot of my job (data entry/cleaning), getting a freelance data scientist would be too expensive while keeping me on board. My salary isn't huge by DS standards, but it's a particularly large chunk of revenue because I'm basically responsible for the majority of contracts right now.

&amp;#x200B;

If you read the whole thing, you're my hero. Just trying to figure out my and my family's life while minimizing risk (as many people in the DS field tend to do naturally)."

Every time I’ve posted on this sub, I’ve gotten pretty good advice from everyone, so I thought I’d reach out again for this scenario. 

I will be starting my first gig as a data scientist in the financial realm soon. In grad school, I was involved in a science lab as a statistician, and they’ve offered to let me continue with them and getting paid. I love the work I do with them and I’m in the middle of a project that could get me some publications. I’d also like to keep the option of a PhD open a few years down the line, so this is an excellent opportunity to stay involved in academia. 

My question now is: how do I bring this up with my new workplace? I plan to put my new job first, but on weekends/in the evenings when I’m done with my DS job for the day, I’d like to put in a few hours into my research. I don’t believe conflicts of interest will be an issue, as the fields are completely unrelated, don’t use any similar technology, and are jobs are located in different states. My PI has also stated that he knows I’ll be busy and has no strict expectations on how many hours I should be putting in. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? How do I broach the subject without making my new boss worry that I’m not committed to my new job? I’d like to emphasize that this is more of a hobby than something that will be competing with my job. It also gives me access to academic sources that will allow me to stay abreast of new techniques that could arguably improve my work at my main job. 

Thanks in advance for any advice!"

\- responsible for data analysis and predictive customer experience

\- responsible for accounting, recruitment of new additions

\- standardization of the ETL process, maintenance of the customer database

\- ensure that the data analysis processing meets specifications

requirements: 

\- modern classification, regression and dimensionality reduction techniques 

\- (some) experience with data science stack in R and/or Python

My Scala script works flawlessly on local with mock parquet data. It isn't doing anything advanced - just identifying differences between two ostensibly identical dataframes, so using basic operations like counts, groupBys, joins, intersects, etc.

However it is struggling to finish running on our cluster with real data. Upon further inspection by logging into the cluster, I can see that my application did some counts that took less than a minute ...and proceeded to do nothing at all afterwards.

https://i.redd.it/d7okftyx9fi51.png

This idle state is endless as far as I can tell - I've seen it persist for over 24 hours. 

I can see that the counts on Line 142 and 143 were the last tasks that were performed. I've pasted an excerpt of my Scala code surrounding Lines 142 and 143 below.

There really isn't any senior or a manager that helps us guide through any of the daily tasks we do here and we mainly just find a project to do and try to execute it. So far, we've made a recommendation engine, a chatbot using RASA, and we cover stuff like monthly analytics and other stuff. I've gained a lot of knowledge working in the company by studying in the background and applying it in my work.

I have a strong interest in deeply exploring data to extract insights and doing the whole idea of 'data driven decision making' in order to generate sales or for helping out with marketing strategies by segmenting users, but the problem here is that I can't define a business problem, I've just been running around with the data I have,  but I can't figure out how to use what I've gathered. For example, I have made a mathematical model for classifying users based on activity but I don't know how to move forward with it. I presented it to my CTO and he said we could use it to try and solve business problems but again, I don't know what the business problems are here. There's barely any communication with CEO/CMO so I end up being frustrated not being able to do anything. Is there anything I should take initiative of from my end to try and figure out how I could use the data we have in order to make decisions? I don't want to sound stupid approaching the CEO/CMO with nothing valuable to ask.

And for those who are wondering, my app is a platform made for students in which they earn points by locking their phones, and can use those points to unlock offers at retail stores, restaurants, etc. And also provides a platform for students to apply to scholarships for universities."

I would to build a regression model using the pants weight, to get the % of material used, since getting the material used is time consuming and costly.

In order to check if there’s a correlation between weight and MU, should I get a correlation for each pants type(blue skinny), or could I do it based on all my population?

If I do it for each subpopulation, should I make sure to have enough sample of tests done for each one of them, and move forward only with the ones I have a 100% of the sample size?

Also my budget isn't unlimited so I would mainly be looking at the second hand market if possible.

The server would primarily be used to host pretrained models, but could be used do some hyperparameter tuning in the background.

My thought was high core count (dual old Xeon?) with plenty of ram with a middle-ish Nvidia GPU in case I throw a few Deep Learning models on it.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Edit:

The plan is to host models either permanently an API or to whirl up the container holding the model if for batch processing.

The reason why I'm thinking high core count is for the potential of having different models (in staging / production) scoring the same data. So there could be 1 model in prod with multiple ones in staging where their performance is being monitored."

Posting here as I place myself closer to data science than computer science/coding in general — but please point me to a more suitable subreddit for this type of question if you can.

TLDR: after watching some anime I thought that learning data science/programming has a lot in common with what protagonists undergo throughout the series. List of questions below.

&amp;#x200B;

1. In some stories, a hero has to master certain techniques (=coding/analysis methods), understanding of his enemies/different battling conditions (=domains&amp;different problems you can tackle), as well as train your spirit (=soft skills, e.g. grit to push through a problem, meta-skills like knowing how to approach a new problem/domain, etc). I wonder if you can make an effective learning path by approaching a DS education in the same way that a good anime takes you through a protagonist's development.  
 
2. Zooming in, one of the crucial skills you need to power through learning data science and get good at it is not quitting when you face a problem, e.g. you can't troubleshoot your code or you're stuck and can't find a solution. As I see it, the basic idea is: when you work in data science, there's always something you don't know. There are hundreds of layers between what you type in your IDE and the result that comes out: you work with libraries, then there's python code that you write, open-source tools, several layers of data architecture, infrastructure, your OS, algorithms, networking/data eng quirks and so on. Even seasoned data scientists know like 30% of the stack they utilize to get results. So it's okay to not know something, you just need to stay motivated to learn more, aiming for a point when you know like 80% of quirks that can happen when working on your chosen role &amp; domain. Explaining the importance of this aspect to a newbie is somewhat hard and it seems like a short comics might do better than a lecture here. Have you seen any related comics that get ideas like that across?  
 
3. This approach would work well for someone who is really passionate about mastering data science in detail like those anime characters master their craft (whatever that may be). I guess you can call it a samurai way or whatever when someone focused all their energy on a single thing and get incredibly good at it. Do you think this would work for the rest 90% of people who aren't ready to go all-in in that manner? I put myself in that 90%, and yet I feel really inspired by this type of character, so maybe it would work for the rest of us as well?  
 
4. I'm interested in this idea because it shows how much more there is to know about data science than most courses teach you. Most of those walks you through hard skills, usually without even connecting them to actual domains &amp; typical applications. Some bootcamps give you a chance to train your soft skills when completing small end-to-end projects in a team, but it still feels very limited. I'll be glad if someone proves me wrong or point to a methodology that touches on most of the points mentioned above.  
 

I wanted to do a proper intro, explaining how I end up thinking about this, but then decided it won't be really relevant here, since the anime is about cars and drifting and it'll probably look weird to expand on this in a data science subreddit. If you're curious to hear more, let me know in the thread and I'll provide full backstory.

Would love to hear your thoughts and discuss all of this further!"

Any auditors out here? 

I am in a company starting up a data team within the internal audit department at a large distribution/warehousing company. We have mainly done projects which are more akin to data analytics than data science, but looking for ideas to expand. 

Basically, our team needs to brainstorm business risks and use the data to show the business is adequately responding to that risk. For example, recently we have had projects where we did a fuzzy match on payments made in order to find duplicate payments, and analytics to show that employee facility access badges are consistently deactivated on the day of termination. But these are more akin to analytics rather than data science, and we want to get more applications which are closer to data science. 

I have some questions: 

1) Does anyone here do anything similar? Anybody in Internal Audit? 

2) What would be some good ideas for data science applications to pitch to my team? I realize I've given very little to work with, but I'm hoping many of these don't need to be company-specific. Our mandate really is quite broad and is as simple as identifying a business risk and using data to show if it is being mitigated properly. 

3) Are there resources available which might be good for me to look into? I really can't find anything good for data science as it pertains to internal audit.

It is my first data science job (I went to grad school after working few years as a BI), and I guess many of you could imagine what I went through over several months— trying to find some doable projects and working on them with limited resources and knowledge. 

It’s been tough, but I learned a lot and I could see I was improving gradually. Looking back it’s been pretty good until today, when my manager announced that I’m going to train new team members transferred from other teams and potential new hires. She told me we will develop an internal data bootcamp for these new members with not familiar with modeling or advanced analytics.

My manager and other existing team members are not really technical people, and they were expecting me to take a lead and somehow make a plan to teach new hires and make them full stack data scientists.. (daunting, yeah?) 

She said it will be a great opportunity for me to be better data scientist and tried to persuade me saying how training experience and thing like that.

I was not sure how to react. Frankly I was overwelmed by all these sudden responsibilities and unrealistic expectations. So I told her that I’m still a junior data scientist and suggested her to give up this internal data science camp thing and hire people who are already data scientists. But she told me that these new team members are eager to learn and she does not have enough budget for hiring REAL data scientist like me. It was surprising to hear that because I’ve thought my salary is bit lower than average.. ($78K, southeast)

Questions

1. Is this really good opportunity to me? Some say teaching is the best way to learn something... but I’m not sure even where to start.

2. Is training and teaching non-technical colleagues common responsibility as a data scientist? I just feel it’s too much responsibility- with all the existing works. 

3. Do you think it is feasible plan for a junior data scientist? Training someone to be an expert. I’m already worried about blinds leading blinds situation.

————————————————

TL;DR: My manager wants me (junior DS) to teach non-technical new hires/members to be data scientists to save money to hire real ones, any tips?

—————————————————-

Edit:

I just read all the comments and realized I’m in deep shit... dang. But still would like to know if there’s any tips that could help me to somehow wisely deal with this situation

—————————————————-

Edit2:

Talked with my manager about this. She likes my work and my capability, and she basically wants me to somehow teach other people to do my tasks, which are building dashboards, basic ML models, and analysis. She wants to grow my team and said no when I suggested her to hire senior/principal data scientist. She said I'm good enough, and she was relying on me. Instead, she will add 2-3 analysts to my team. In terms of raise or promotion, she mentioned if I could successfully do this (internal boot camp), I'd get a promotion (not 100% though).

I'm so frustrated since I learned what she asked me to do is an almost impossible job for me, and I don't think I can find a new, better job anytime soon."

The way this is shown in a dataset is that EACH ad has a line PER DAY with the number of conversions associated (like, clicking on a website button that implies the consumer is interested). 

Q1. Would it be correct to compare July data as a whole to August data or should I further segment them?

Q2. If I did compare by month, would these be paired or unpaired? My thoughts would be that these are paired since they are continuous and that they are both advertising on Google. But maybe I’m thinking incorrectly. If these are unpaired (because 1 month contains 5 ads while the other contains 2), then would it be correct to say that if I compared identical advertisements by month are paired?

A little non-resume background: early-to-mid stage in my career and want to carve out the relatively niche path combining geospatial and data science. In recent years I feel as though sharpened my open source python stack skills, applying concepts as I learn at an extremely accommodating engineering startup. 

Recently, I've been looking to take my career to the next step. I want to set up resume eyeing space-industry geospatial companies such as Planet Labs ([https://www.planet.com/](https://www.planet.com/)) , Descartes Labs ([https://www.descarteslabs.com/](https://www.descarteslabs.com/)), or Orbital Insight ([https://orbitalinsight.com/](https://orbitalinsight.com/)). 

While I'm happy where I'm at and make pretty good bucks currently, I've been considering applying to PhD programs in the Earth Sciences in hopes to bring the world of open source data science to the field and exercise some scientific 'freedom' per say. I've always felt like academia was right for me (I know this isn't an earth science group, but I'm talking applied DS here essentially).

At the same time I have also asked my company for a promotion track to Spatial Data Scientist, and seeing as though I'm more or less fresh at the applied ML stuff they are offering to pay for some online certification in Data Science if I choose to do so. 

My questions for you who have made it this far in this post are: What do you think? Particularly--do you know of any reputable online DS certification courses geared towards intermediate career folks such as myself? Conversely, do you reckon having a PhD in an applied science field can be beneficial for this career path as well? 

Really just looking for open ended feedback, any advice is beyond welcome :)"

I'm trying to set this up to be usable by a wider team at work, so doing a bunch of janky manual configuration in bash to get a conda environment set up JUST RIGHT, and then editing R config files to point to that conda environment by default is a no-go. Or, if that's the only way it works, I need to create a docker image that gets all that crap out of the way.

One of the blogs I came across (I forget the source) commented on the ""optimistically named"" functions in this package, such as \`use\_conda\_env()\`, which don't actually do what they are intended to. As of right now, there are 276 open issues on the package's GitHub. It's a hot mess.

If anyone has been successful getting this package to work, can you please point me in the right direction? My use case is that we have a custom python ML library that my team uses, and I want to make it easy for the team members who prefer R to be able to use these functions interchangeably with their R code, within RStudio.

I currently work (whilst studying) as a full stack web dev and it has really got me thinking about whether or not I want to become a software engineer. I've only ever worked in web dev and I don't know if it's just this job or what but I'm really not enjoying the work that much, it's just not as interesting as it was when I was first learning web dev.

I've always been interested in the data science stuff (and I love python a lot and machine learning) but I've always been kind of deterred from a career in this field due to the fact that it's not necessarily coding / tech orientated (this is the idea that I have in my mind). 

My worse fear is getting a job and not learning / using technical skills, not writing code and just using like excel or something. I've always thought of myself as an engineer rather than a scientist.

I'd love to engineer data science solutions, to work in both modelling and also writing the code to deploy those models (backend stuff), maintain them and build data pipelines etc that enable them. I love learning and using tools like docker and setting up cloud infra to get things to work. 

Is my idea of being a data scientist just wrong? I think my dream job would be a machine learning engineer right? A software engineer with a background in machine learning?

Any help would be great as I'd really like to get the right mindset and attitude before starting my career.

I'm currently transitioning to the DS field from an R background and have seen some conflicting information about the usefulness of R and I'm hoping to get more clarity from those of you working the field. Keep in mind that while I love R dearly, I'm 100% on board with learning Python and get why it's vital to DS. I also think that R is very good at what it does, but I can see how Python would be superior for particular tasks, e.g. ML, and would have more general applicability - so no hate to either language here! 

On the one hand, I've seen/heard folks mention that R is one of the main data science languages and is useful to pick up. It seems commonly advocated for learning/doing data science. On the other hand, from my perusing of job descriptions and from talking to an (admittedly small) sample of data scientists, it has been strongly implied that Python is the industry standard and that a job requiring/focusing on R is more of a rare unicorn. I have seen a few job postings for or with R, but the impression I get is that it's a bonus, whereas Python is a must. I imagine it also depends on the type of data scientist position since an inferential analyst might be more likely to use R than a ML data scientist for instance.

My general takeaway is that while R is useful and can be better for particular things (e.g. tidyverse, more complex/specific statistical models), Python largely satisfies general needs (particularly ML for instance) and many folks can get by just with Python. **So why is R still recommended so much for data science? How much do you actually use R if you also use Python at your job?** I realize things are fast paced and have changed a lot over the years so I'm not sure if the advice I've seen regarding R is antiquated or more specific to data analyst jobs (though SAS seems more common for those tbh). 

Any thoughts and perspectives are appreciated."

First time on sub, sorry if this is an ‘ask google’ question, but I haven’t been able to find much literature on this.

At work we have a multiclass classification problem whereby we have to take millions of unlabelled documents and sort them into several categories. We use Keras and Python for this and it’s very effective.

We have run across an issue with some of our data coming in - a statistically relevant number of documents come in ‘stuck together’, as in the PDF file or scan containing the document actually contains 2 separate documents. This leads to two main problems where a document comes in where either:

1. the first X pages should be labelled ‘A’ but the next Y pages should be labelled ‘B’
2. The first X pages should be labelled ‘A’, the next Y pages should ALSO be labelled ‘A’, but needs to be delimited and treated as a separate unit.

At present, our only solution is to send a person in to eyeball documents and make sure they’re not ‘multiples’ before okaying them.

Right now we are exploring a Multi-labelling approach where we can say ‘the document is both A and B’. I am bearish on this approach because it’s not really like the holistic document is both A and B all the way through, it is actually exclusively A and then B. Plus, that doesn’t give us a solve for problem 2.


Just wondering if anyone’s had experience with a similar problem, a paper they’ve read with a similar issue or maybe has a good idea on how to solve?"

As data science enthusiasts, a few months ago, we built a tool for data scientists to share their insights using visualizations and dashboards in pure Python or R and not requiring additional programming or front-end development.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fly6z5/publishing\_tracking\_and\_sharing\_data/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fly6z5/publishing_tracking_and_sharing_data/)

We received feedback from communities that a tool like this one should integrate a lot more data science frameworks. For example, a user should be able to push a matplotlib plot, a Tensorflow model, a plotly chart, a pandas data frame, and a presentation layer to fully-support it.   Supporting all the data artifacts and providing all the tools to work with them solely seems to be a very challenging if not impossible task.

Keeping this in mind, we have happily decided to open source the core of the product to the community  
 [https://github.com/dstackai/dstack](https://github.com/dstackai/dstack)

We would like to now focus on supporting new use cases for the community, e.g., ML applications in the area of NLP, computer vision, and AutoML.

Therefore, I would like to start a discussion here to understand the following: What different use cases would you ideally like to be supported by the dstack open source framework?"

What are the negatives about the job? Help me set my expectations straight Hey guys! I'm currently a software engineer and I've been thinking of switching to data science for some time now, but after doing tons of research I still can't figure out exactly what skillset one would need to be a good data scientist, and *exactly* what data scientists need to do on a day to day basis in terms of coding/bugs/problems. Although I enjoy coding, there are some things about being a software engineer I definitely don't enjoy, and I have it in my head that switching to data science will fix all my problems and kinda be the best of both world, in terms of doing the things I enjoy as well as getting rid of the things I do not enjoy about my current job. Hoping you guys can give some insight as to whether, based on the things I enjoy/dislike, you think I'd enjoy data science.

What I definitely dislike about software engineering:

1. Having to be available outside of work. My company doesn't exactly have the best processes in place, and we don't have pushing out code automated yet, so my boss is stuck waking up at 2am every 3 weeks to manually push out the code. Since he's leaving soon, I'll most likely have to help do that as well. In addition, I currently have to leave my phone on those nights to respond to/fix bugs if there are serious issues. I want a job where I can work reasonable hours (about 40 hours a week) and don't need to take my work home with me
2. Bugs! My team is relatively small, and although we do have a few QA people, they don't catch everything. I get such bad anxiety every time it's a release day, wondering if I'll have to wake up to a bunch of issues with my code not working or breaking existing things for our customers.
3. DevOps. I have the type of roll where I need to do a little of everything, including some devops types of tasks. That stuff kinda bores me tbh 

I have it in my head that data science will kinda be the best of both worlds, where I can use the skills I have/love (problem solving, logic, analytical thinking, math) but without the things I don't exactly love. Do data scientists need to worry about any of things mentioned above? If so, how, or what other problems come along with the job?

tldr; I want to switch to data science, but I think I have unrealistic expectations about how glamorous the job is, do data scientists generally have to worry about dealing with issues outside of work hours, fixing last minute emergency bugs, or DevOps type tasks?"

I am working on quite a challenging project that involves document classification. There are actually more than 15 classes, but for now, I am just working with the top 5 of them. The dataset is anyway severely imbalanced in that the top 2 classes constitute over 80% of the data.  
Another source of complexity is that, as you understand, the same document type can have various types of layouts depending on the company, and even within one company it might be different.

My initial attempt was based on treating documents as images, but this one didn't succeed since some documents are very similar visually so the visual-based classifier fails badly trying to tell the difference between such document types.

What approaches would you recommend with regard to NLP?  
I have tried tf-idf vectorizer + naive Bayes/linear SVM, but the results are not that great, and I believe such methods are far from being state-of-the-art as of today.

I know that a lot of projects use BERT transformers from hugging face for anything text-related and there are libraries like FastText that can handle classification pretty well.

Nevertheless, I would highly appreciate some guidance with regard to what approach could work well for imbalanced data and document classification in general.

The primary languages for analysts and data science are R and Python, but there are a number of ""no code"" tools such as RapidMiner, BigML and some other (primarily ETL) tools which expand into the ""data science"" feature set.

As an engineer with a good background in computer science, I've always seen these tools as a bad influencer in the industry. I have also spent countless hours arguing against them. 

Primarily because they do not scale properly, are not maintainable, limit your hiring pool and eventually you will still need to write *some* code for the truly custom approaches.

Also unfortunately, there is a small sector of data scientists who only operate within that tool set. These data scientists tend not to have a deep understanding of what they are building and maintaining.

However it feels like these tools are getting stronger and stronger as time passes. And I am recently considering ""if you can't beat them, join them"", avoiding hours of fighting off management, and instead focusing on how to seek the best possible implementation.

So my questions are:

* Do you use no code DS tools in your job? Do you like them? What is the benefit over R/Python? Do you think the proliferation of these tools is good or bad?

* If you solidly fall into the no-code data science camp, how do you view other engineers and scientists who strongly push code-based data science?

I think the data science sector should be continuously pushing back on these companies, please change my mind.

**Edit:** 
Here is a summary so far:

* I intentionally left my post vague of criticisms of no-code DS on purpose to fuel a discussion, [but one user adequately summarized the issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/i6hh5u/whats_your_opinion_on_nocode_data_science/g0wnyy4/). To be clear my intention was not to rip on data scientists who use such software, but to find at least some benefits instead of constantly arguing against it. For the trolls, this has nothing to do about job security for python/R/CS/math nerds. I just want to build good systems for the companies I work for while finding some common ground with people who push these tools.

* One takeaway is that no code DS lets data analysts extract value easily and quickly even if they are not the most maintainable solutions. This is desirable because it ""democratizes"" data science, sacrificing some maintainability in favor of value.

* Another takeaway is that a lot of people believe that this is a natural evolution to make DS easy. Similar to how other complex programming languages or tools were abstracted in tech. While I don't completely agree with this in DS, I accept the point.

* Lastly another factor in the decision seems to be that hiring R/Python data scientists is expensive. Such software is desirable to management. 

While the purist side of me wants to continue arguing the above points, I accept them and I just wanted to summarize them for future reference."

I'm currently a data analyst and am having a very difficult time in providing insights of any value. I currently analyze the effectiveness of a company x's advertising on Facebook. Normally, I would use Excel or SQL to analyze the data. However, I've been realizing that a lot of my insights are basic generalizations, like creating regression lines, finding which ad performed the best, which ad had the worst and best ROI, and the likes. Now, I wish to provide something related to statistics so that I'm able to bring better insights.

While studying statistics, my understanding is that a lot of tools like standard deviations, t-scores, z-scores, and so on require a dataset to be normally distributed. However, let's say I was analyzing the amount of clicks one advertisement received over the course of the year. The data has a very heavy right-skew due to the very high number of days the advertisement received ZERO clicks. 

What would be the best course to statistically analyze this data set? If I wanted to understand standard deviation, I know to transform it, since the SD of a skewed data doesn't say much. So, skewed, the SD is 3000. However, if I do a log +0.5, the SD is 3. If I apply the exp to it, then it's 25. Is this the right way to find SD on a right-skewed graph?

What else could I do so that I can start discovering cool things? I guess I lack the experience and guidance at my current company.

I'm trying to create a predictive model that attempts to predict the likelihood of a product converting.

I noticed that in creating models A and B, model B really outperforms model A using various performance metrics (such as MSE, R\^2). However, in practice, model A performs better in predicting behavior.

This really surprised me. When I looked at the differences in predictions, it seems that while in terms of pure prediction power model B is in fact better (getting the probability of conversion right), it tends to make more mistakes for large value items than model A. So its wins are offset by its losses.

It seems to me that I need to factor in the value of the product into the model as well. I'm not sure how to do that. Or perhaps modify the error function to use the value.

Since it's not a problem like stock prediction (financially) where future values depend on past values, I am unsure if having an equal representation of each year in the splits would leak to data leakage.

I'll preface this post by noting the fact that I am not a DB admin, I do not have access to create ETL, stored procedures, or even tables. I work as an Analyst/Data Scientist with read access to write SQL scripts.

&amp;nbsp;

A lot of my job involves pulling data from our ERP systems to make sense of what is going on in our operations and supply chain. Through the years, I've built several SQL scripts that I would call my base SQL script that would answer basic business questions like: 

* What is my demand forecast? 
* What are the current open orders? 
* How much inventory do we currently have? 
* How much does part X cost?

&amp;nbsp;

From these scripts, I usually recycle these scripts with a SELECT INTO #temp_table depending on what questions need to be answered. Some examples would be:

* Is our inventory inflating?
* How did changing X affect our demand forecast (what-ifs analysis)?
* How are we performing to budget? 
* Are we over-ordering (supply and demand balancing)?
* Where are the opportunities to push orders into the next fiscal year?


&amp;nbsp;

So without contaminating the base SQL scripts to answer these questions, I usually save these in a new file and store in a project folder.

&amp;nbsp;

The problem I am running into is that, sometimes there are things that I've identified that could improve the accuracy of the data pulled or there are changes in some business process that will require an update of the base SQL scripts. As a result, I would need to go and update the base SQL scripts to reflect the new reality.

&amp;nbsp;

Now you can imagine, if I have several SQL scripts that were derived from the base SQL script, I'd need to go update all of those SQL scripts including the base SQL script as well. This is becoming a PITA and difficult to manage now. I am wondering if there is another less painful way of managing this. And I guess the answer of going to the BI team and telling them to create an ETL job or stored procedure/views is an acceptable answer, but I'd like to exhaust any other options before I get to that point."

I'm a faculty member who teaches data science, and the discussion at https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/i3o4fe/i_am_tired_of_being_assessed_as_a_software/ makes me very curious: **is there no need for math and stats in data science? Or is my experience as a data analyst just oddly statistically driven (tons of hypothesis testing and statistical inference)?**

I teach an intro data science class, and if I need to emphasize the engineering skills more, I *will* bring them into my class. However, there's just way too much noise to sort through:

* Most undergraduate and some graduate-level data science programs (and similarly-purposed programs, such as business analytics) I've seen do not require calculus I, even for admission to masters-level programs. **So does this mean that practitioners don't need to be aware of foundational concepts such as derivatives?**
* Some programs (usually Big-10) I've seen go all out on the math: requiring multivariable calculus, two semesters of linear algebra, and about 2-3 semesters of algorithms at the undergraduate level and requiring this background prior to admission at the masters level
* Programs that I've seen, particularly at the undergraduate and masters level, *do not seem* to emphasize data cleansing - not to mention data engineering skills. There is an undergraduate-level program that I am aware of which covers *Introduction to Statistical Learning* (ISL) in one semester toward the end of the program. Do people really expect you to know the algorithms at the level of what is provided in ISL (which I add was clearly not meant for STEM majors), translate the code to Python, and then start applying these concepts in the workforce? 

As a faculty member who has also been a practitioner in industry, **I'm** frustrated trying to figure out what to best teach my students, and if I can't figure it out, I can't imagine having spent my whole career in academia and trying to learn this all on my own with textbooks. I want to make sure that whatever I teach will provide value to my students when they graduate. 

Any advice would be extremely helpful. For the record: what I teach in my class is a whole semester on data manipulation and automated reporting in R, T-SQL, Excel, and Access. I don't go into machine learning at all. I am considering trying out teaching Pandas in this class for the first time this fall."

This is anecdotal and has worked for me, I hope it works for you! 

1. Use arrows 
I tend to have so many hot fire ideas and solutions pouring out of my brain, Losing scope of a project. I remedied this by drawing arrows from IDEA to SOLUTION. Using my short attention span to my advantage, I could pour my mind out on paper and link those ideas to solutions, so whenever I need a structure, the arrows offer visual aid; removing the pesky anxious feelings. 

2. Writing diarrhea
Get everything out. When you’re flooded by thoughts, write down one word that associates with that thought. Keep going. You’ll run out of things to write down. If some of these things make sense to you, refer to 1. And draw some arrows! 

3. Tree diagrams and prune
When you’re overwhelmed by what you want to do first, using your word diarrhea and arrows, build from those components. Look at those connections, what makes it achievable to go from a to b? Extend the edges from component a to all it’s children, likewise for b, c and so on. 
COME BACK TO IT AT A LATER TIME!!! This is important. Come back to your mess of words with structured arrows and begin pruning. You may realize that neural net you wanted to program uses too much time! However maintain the links from left to right, from idea to product. 
Here’s an example: 

Idea: I want to predict house prices, product: send as analysis tool to sales team. 

From idea
        Program in python
        Program in c++ 

From product 
       Deliver as REST API 
       Deliver as an excel spreadsheet with formula 


Now you come back at a later time. You notice that you don’t want to program it in c++, and you want to deliver it as a function for excel. Prune that tree. 

4. Meditate at work
Take time off to spend 10 minutes outside or in another room practicing your breath. Keep it simple, think of your breath and let your natural thoughts come in. Try to go back to your breath. 

These worked wonders for me. I spend every morning drawing arrows! We have trello to keep track of our projects, but I’d still get lost anyway. The visual aid of an arrow works wonders for me, and I honestly can’t explain that, however, try it for yourself. 

Writing things down feels like I’m taking a massive shit after a heavy night of curry, once it’s out I feel so relieved. 

I hope this helps, and if you have any

Is this a realistic expectation or am I just over sensationalizing what a data scientist does?

When i'm thinking about my next career move, I feel like I want it to be a bit more ""data science"", but I'm not able to enunciate what is realistic in what I want. so I want to ask the group of data scientists here what your day looks like, from a work perspective. Is it like me, answering business questions with one off models, or are there more coding and things I mentioned above?  Am I already a typical data scientist or is there traditionally more to it?"

IT... not so clear, and I don’t mean a data scientist who serves the entire organization but is nested under the IT department for some reason. I’m talking about an IT department that is trying to improve their service by bringing in a DS to solve their (business) problems. Sure, there might be some interesting work in cyber security, but you won’t be doing that for a run of the mill IT department. They’ll just buy a product/service from somewhere with way more data resources to make good decisions from. At best maybe KPI and SLA metrics, depending on the org. That kind of thing takes a few hours at best, not enough to fill a roll. More likely you’d be doing data engineering and dev ops, which are not data science. Possibly just implementing whatever the other analysts and DS have done from other departments if you’re in some SWE savvy IT department, but that’s not solving business problems for IT. That’s just doing work for other departments.

But really what I’m wondering is what day to day analytics and data science can be done for that sort of stereotypical IT department? Think the kind with a few tier I, some sys admins and a few infrastructure people, maybe a DBA, possibly a few IT devs that are halfway between SRE and just writing scripts or queries as needed. With 99.999% SLAs at some organizations, redundancies are super over engineered. Usually the biggest business problems are just having budgets that are too small to support the organization.

I have about 1 year of data science experience and about 1+ years of data analyst experience (total 2.5 YOE). I'm grateful to receive two offers so I am curious about fellow data science practitioners' opinions here.

I'm located in an Asian city and I received an offer from ByteDance as a data analyst, which is the parent company of TikTok. The compensation package is actually higher than the data scientist offer from a top Asian bank that is going all-in on digital transformation.

From what I gathered during the interview, the data analyst will be insight generation and building the analytics framework for the particular business function in the APAC HQ from scratch. However, there would be no predictive modeling (even though this role would be involved in building the data pipelines for the predictive models). As for the data scientist role, there are interesting projects involving NLP, marketing analytics, and customer segmentation / churn prediction, customer geo-targeting. The bank's main operations are in Southeast Asia, China, Hong Kong, India, and Australia.

From a career development viewpoint, ByteDance offers better prestige and the exit opps to other tech firms would be great. As for the bank DS, it would expose me less to the tech world but the projects would allow me to develop my skills in machine learning.

People may point to the potential banning of TikTok in US, but in Asia, TikTok is still wildly popular, and ByteDance is still one of the highest-valued unicorn in the world. Even without the US and Indian market, TikTok is still wildly successful.

Organizational information, transactional information, hierarchical information, knowledge graphs.

The math of characterizing and working with graphs is well documented and understood, but as far as I can tell, not well implemented in data science tools.

The problem seems to be memory explosions as low-level engines sequentially calculate Cartesian products of every possible relation and then filter for the specific types of relations you happen to be looking for. Do this over more than a few hops and you'll bring any small or medium sized system to its knees.

This problem has obviously been solved by people who work with truly big graphs (Google and Facebook and friends), but I suspect that at least some of the time they are doing it simply with brute force, and anything more clever than this they keep proprietary.

This matters because you can actually represent graph information as a matrix, and  (some) matrix manipulations are extremely well implemented with open source software and accelerated by GPU hardware. You still have a risk of a memory explosion for dense graphs, but you've got built-in ways to serialize these kinds of calculations so that you're just slowing down, not crashing. 

The most important bit is that real-world graphs are more often than not sparse matrices. Sparse matrices can be serialized with a triplet structure, that is extremely efficient. There are both R and Python implementations of this available.

It should be possible to write wrapper functions that can take graph data structures as Node set, Edge set and transform them efficiently to sparse matrix triplets. It should also be possible to implement the most common graph algorithms to work as matrix operations in a way that is suitable for GPU acceleration. 

If anyone knows if this has already been done in open source, please let me know.

The offer is 160k base, 15% annual bonus, 5.5k annually towards tuition (I’m working on my MS part time with Georgia Tech OMAnalytics), 6% 1:1 401k match, 4 weeks vacation, 2 weeks worth of company holidays.

As far as cost of living, I could stay in Dallas, which is definitely lower than the Bay Area or NYC. 

I’m in the pipeline at other companies, but is this offer worth taking and dropping out of the running elsewhere? I suppose I could take it and continue interviewing, but I really would like to avoid that because I did have a strong connection and wouldn’t want to leave them high and dry.

For example:

* Logistic and linear regression are almost always used
* In classification, features are manually binned and replaced by their WOE (basically impact-encoding is used for all features)
* Variable selection: removing correlated features -&gt; filter method to exclude some features -&gt; stepwise feature selection, with strict p-value-based criteria for features entering/leaving the model
* The final model rarely has more than 10 features (selected from a pool of 200-300)

These practices seem *very* common in finance talking to more experienced people on my team. My manager is very open to modernizing and increasing the flexibility of our approach, but based on conversations i've had with senior managers and directors they tend to be more skeptical.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if we were suggest implemeting a non-linear/ensemble approach (e.g. lightgbm/xgboost/random forest) with 100 features, common concerns might be:

1. **Stability** \- Flexible models with many features produce 'less-stable predictions'
2. **Deterioration** \- Flexible models with many features may perform better initially but will degrade in performance much faster and require re-training/re-development more frequently
3. **Diagnosis** \- If something goes wrong, it's harder to figure out why
4. **Interpretability** \- There is a real trade-off between performance and parsimony, and that a simpler method is worth sacrificing (sometimes considerable) cross-validation/test/future data accuracy

I personally haven't seen evidence to support 1, 2 &amp; 4. It particularly makes very little sense when we might include externally sourced features in our 'simple model' that are outputs of another predictive model, so these 'individual features' aren't so simple and are basically a function of 300 others! I think that 3 is a more legitimate concern, but that approaches like SHAP or simply monitoring changes in features over time could help with this.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a big paper-reader but a lot of [Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1009213726) resonated with things I have seen in industry. I suspect that many of these concerns and best practices probably originate from a mixture of explanatory statistics and tradition in credit risk modeling. I also think that a certain amount of it might be hearsay or a fear of the unknown.

Having said that, these directors have decades of practical modeling experience combined (most of it follows this classical credit-risk/banking framework) and are very intelligent and knowledgeable. On the other hand, I am in the first few years of my career and am still learning all the time.

I am curious if there has been much research on this topic, if you guys have found (in your experience) any/all of these concerns to be legitimate, and how you might approach alleviating them if they aren't. Thanks!"

This morning, I got an email for a remote Data Scientist position with BAH. The job description sounded legitimate and it said ""We successfully reviewed your resume and it has been approved for an virtual screening test/interview by Booz Allen Hamilton Inc, for the position of ***Data Scientist*** (REMOTE)."" They also asked me to confirm my name and city listed on my resume, which I thought was strange, but not out of the realm of possibility. The person listed to contact has a LinkedIn profile with 300 connections and is listed as a BAH employee.

I said I was interested in the interview and that I had availability tomorrow. A few hours later, they emailed me with the screening test and let me know I had three hours to complete it. Kind of a dick move, but okay. It consisted of mostly technical questions related to machine learning algorithms.

I sent my answers back to them and received a reply stating they had gotten my answers, would ""forward the \[answers\] to the Hiring Board for their decision,"" and would get back to me with ""feedback from the Board's decision in about an hour or more."" I did not reply. At this point, there were a few warning signs, but nothing overtly obvious that this was a scam.

30 minutes later, I received another email stating that ""I am glad to inform you that due to your level of experience and your working skills, the company has decided to hire you as one of our ***Data Scientists.""***  They wanted my full name, address, email, and phone number for the HR hiring letter. They would also send me a check ""to set up your mini office by purchasing the office equipment and software needed to start your training and work."" They also said I would undergo a few days' training at $20 an hour and then work itself would be $60 an hour.

I was very suspicious at this point, and eventually found [this article](https://adage.com/article/agency-news/job-offer-agency-fake/314615) from two years ago detailing a scam with almost the same details but from a different company. This has confirmed to me that it is indeed a scam, which is disappointing given the current job market. I have been looking for a job for a while now and it's unfortunate that people are trying to take advantage of that, especially now. I wanted to post this in case anyone else had received this email and to let them know it's not legitimate."

Hi folks, I need your advice.

I came across a very poor quality paper recently, it was oublished in a reviewed journal. I don't want to tell which one was it, as I feel that wouldn't be a great thing to do. The paper itself was written by a professor from a more or less well respected business school. The analysis however is not only poor (underreporting results, which are just a correlation r value plus a line on a graph), it is exactly the type which makes a lot of people look at quantitative social science and political science as a child's playground.

The paper is based on a classification algorithm, which is so poorly documented, that you can only get any kind of accuracy from one single graph (nothing in the text), which actually shows that almost half of the cases were classified with an error so large, that it could span across three categories. The classification is based on a range, where classes span 5 units of measurement. The error for ~46% of classified data points is at least 5.5, so theoretically this is as ambigous as it gets. The algorithm is only documented in 4 pages, so there is literally nothing to go on. The first paper cites the short paper, and links to a google drive for the source code, but the link throws a 404, despite the paper coming out a week ago.

I have nothing against the author, I have nothing in making them retract the paper. I've been working in data modelling for years now, and linear models are my specialty, so I'm fairly certain I'm right. I'm also active academically, and as a person who tries to legitimize quantitative social sciences, I think papers like this hurt us a great deal.

Is it a dick move if I voice my concerns to the journal?

EDIT: wow this blew up. Thank you for the comments, I will read them until they come. I wrote to the managing editors, phrased a letter, and told them otherwise that I have nothing to gain or lose from this, so it really is their domain to decide. They were very chill about it, and asked for a few weeks time."

Since developing my career, I have been getting more and more exposed to statistics and data. I am able to grasp programming concepts and SQL, and am able to understand database schemas/structures fairly well. However, when it comes to even basic statistics (regression, for example), I just seem to shut down.

When I see formulas or equations that contain letters, I don't know how to explain it, but I just get a complete mental block. If you give me percentages, fractions, proportions, even geometry, I am able to quickly work out solutions - normally faster than the average colleague that I work with. However, I just shut down as soon as I see letters or symbols or Greek letters in a formula. I can't seem to keep track of all the universal variables or assigned variables, and I quickly lose track of the logic in whatever formula or problem I'm working on.

I did learn early on in life that I was much better at ""word problems"" than I was at strict formulas, as I was able to understand the logic in the problem and translate it to a formula a bit more easily than just looking at a formula.

Anyway, I work on a dual project manager/insights role in a healthcare marketing department, adjacent to an advanced analytics team and a team of developers.

I work as a data-lead at a moderately (medium/large) sized civil office. My team and I have been tasked with the development of a data warehouse from scratch. The data we mainly work with are mostly stored on-prem. The data is not big the sense that they are long and frequently measured, but rather big in the sense that they are varied and ""wide"". 

What is both a blessing and a curse for us is that we are (almost) free to choose our data architecture (that is, what kind of database, ETL tool esc.)

The team consists of data scientists who all are experienced and very capable in R. So the team is set up to use R as a weapon of choice. For what it's worth, R has been my weapon of choice for more than a decade now. 

With the introduction of tidyverse and dbplyr to R - it is my opinion that R can now serve a go-to ETL tool for building a data warehouse. 

What I would like to ask this community is: Is there anyone here who has experience building a data warehouse (or a virtual data warehouse) using R as the main ETL tool? What are the pros-and-cons? What pitfalls could lie ahead that I am not seeing - me being very biased towards using R?

If you were in my position, what would you do - if your goal was career growth? Would you stick around, push the envelope with taking on new tools and projects, or jump ship? 

Thanks in advance for any insight!"

I'm familiar with Kaplan-Meier survival curves, which measure the probability that failure has not  occurred by time t. Normally, survival curves like this can handle variable start dates just fine, since the time to failure is assumed to follow some constant distribution. 

The system I am modeling has a deadline as well as variable start dates. For example, if the deadline is May 1st, samples could be 'born' on March 1st, or April 1st, or any date in  between. However, they cannot 'survive' past May 1st. Therefore, the possible range of survival time differs depending on start date. Samples born on April 1st cannot possible survive longer than 30 days, where samples born on March 1st can.

My first  thought was that I need to create a two dimensional survival 'triangle'  with all possible birth dates and time to failures. However, I've never heard of this method. Can anyone help point me in the right direction? Is there any way to create survival curves for samples that have different ranges?"

In genealogy, when researching a family history and/or ancestors, as you go further back in time, you sometimes (or eventually) hit what’s called a 'brick wall'. That's the term for when you are unable to proceed any further in determining who somebody was, who their parents were, where or when they were born or died, etc. This is often the result of insufficient record keeping. As you can imagine, as you go further back in time, record keeping becomes more and more of a problem. 

As a result of a brick wall I’ve hit, I’ve decided to try to attack my ‘brick wall’ in something of a different angle - with data science/analytics. I’m not a data scientist. I have some experience with web analytics (implementation, analyzing, and reporting), but certainly not at the level of the posts that I see in this sub. 

My hypothesis is that I can use known social relationships/networks/interactions in a specific region within the U.S. across 70-80 years (multiple generations) to try to answer some of my questions, the main one being, “of this selection of candidates, who is most likely (and to what likelihood) to be this person’s father and mother?”

The data that I have includes (1) the entirety of the Federal Census records for three counties where all family are known to have lived, (2) church birth records, if/when available for churches within those counties, (3) marriage indexes (which do not include birthdates) for many or most marriages within those three counties, and (4) an incomplete, but sizable, collection of tax records.

What I’m thinking is that of the people who interacted with each other, whether that’s as bondsmen in a marriage, witnesses at birth/marriage, people who lived near each other, or people who were in some other way a part of each other’s social network - their parents also interacted with each other in some or similar ways. Friends of family span across multiple generations. Person A is best buds with Person B because, in part, their parents were best buds. I have seen this several times earlier/later in my own family tree, and it’s pretty interesting to see this insight. 

So, I wanted to reach out to ask for any suggestions/advice anybody might have about how I should go about this. I would appreciate if you can comment or PM. I’m willing to learn what I need to, in order to accomplish this task, even if it takes some time."

For example lets say `dice loss` is being implemented. The formula does not clarify how to deal with the `batch size`. It is worth noting that according to this formula, the value of `loss` will increase if the `batch size` is increased. The obvious intuition would be to normalize the `loss` value using `batch size`. I have two question in this context.

1. Is it theoretically valid to normalize the `loss` using the `batch size`?
2. How to normalize? 

* For example, In case of image the `tensor` at hand is `4D`. The `dice score` / `loss` can be calculated for _each image_ and _each class_ resulting into a `2D` tensor.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now the aggregated `loss` can be calculated as the sum of all elements in the `2D` tensor divided by `batch size`.

* Alternatively, we can ignore the `batch size` from the beginning and generate per class `loss` in a `1D` `tensor`. Finally sum the elements and divide by `batch size` to get the aggregated `loss` value.

**Is there any fundamental difference between these two approaches? Which one is correct (if any)?**

It sounds pessimistic on face value, but in industry I find it to be a very practical skill. In my experience, upper management or outside departments have an overinflated perception of the capabilities of data science in general, but also data science capabilities within the organization. 

I've found this to be true working for very large corporations as well as non-profits. In my opinion, being able to honestly and succinctly articulate the realistic capabilities of the team can drastically improve efficiency and reduce wasted time/energy. 

Again, in my experience, explaining in blunt terms what can/ can't be done to non-technical or not-very-technical is the way to go. I typically start out very broad and explain why what their asking is a bad idea. If that doesn't work, I get more technical and also try to put it into a dollars/man-hours cost benefit type of analysis. Typically once you explain technically why it can't be done OR why it doesn't make sense in terms of money or time, then people start to understand better.

Using this type of strategy from the very outset is the best way to go. The last thing you want to do is overpromise and underperform.

An example, since this is a bit ambiguous, I was working on a team and we were contacted by another department to ""create an algorithm that sorts our emails into various categories."" They had heard from someone that text classification could save them time... Or something like that is what I gathered. Our team knew it was a BS request right off the bat, but my boss was overruled by a superior within the company. We had several (useless) meetings with them where they spilled out their reasons why they needed this to be done.

Long story short, it turns out that they only had 500 emails and there were no real defined categories to put them into. It wasn't until we explained to them that 1) this model would take longer than just going thru the emails by hand 2) would likely not be very accurate and 3) basically cost a teams worth of hours to complete. Ultimately common sense prevailed and they did it by hand."

But what about a most influential profile of feature attributes? Hi r/datascience! 

So recently I've been battling with an interesting modelling project. The task is to create a descriptive model to help determine drivers of a given outcome. Initially, I went with decision trees as these had a good visual element to them and worked well for a previous project whereby one could also determine a 'profile' or set of attributes via the decision paths to one of the leaf nodes leading to a likely outcome determined by the model.

However, I am now dealing with a problem which has many categorical features (hence partial dependency plots are not exactly something applicable) and is more akin to a multiclass problem (I could split it into one vs all binary classification, but would prefer not to). My current thinking is to use catboost (I tried decision trees on this multiclass problem in R and the optimization procedure is too slow for this), which gives good results, but alas it is an ensemble method. I could grab the first decision tree, yes, but it is not the full picture. I have tried Shapley values for this as well, and come up with building some groups of attributes that are influential by using the attributions from the Shapley values. I won't go into detail but rather ask the following question:

Suppose you have a model which yields good performance. Sure, you can retrieve some feature importance from it. But, suppose you want to build a profile let's call it (could be a profile of a lead, or product) of attributes from your features which are very likely to lead to this outcome, as determined by this model. How would you proceed in doing so? Do you know of any techniques, packages etc. which handle this problem? Do you propose any other models which are good with this?

I'm sure this is a situation many of you have come across before, and I was wondering what your thoughts were. Many times when I'm tuning my hyperparameters, I'll find that the model with the best CV error is actually very overfit when comparing the in-fold vs out-of-fold training error. For example, I just ran an xgboost model, and the parameters with the best CV error resulted in a out-of-fold logloss of 0.451, and an in-fold logloss of 0.405. That in-fold logloss is 11% lower than the out of fold, which seems excessive. If I created a model with these parameters, I would expect it to be overfit. However, I would also expect it to generalize well based on logloss criteria.

So, what are the general thoughts on how 'different' in-fold vs out-of-fold errors should be? I know there isn't a formula or any hard set rules - I was just wondering how people handled situations like this. I personally up the regularization parameters somewhat before creating my final model."

I know the question is kinda dumb but I am trying to learn a skill/strategy that is usually not taught in school/books/moocs.

I have heard a lot that one of the best ways of learning is to ""learn it on the job"" specially when it comes to machine learning and data science (given their rapid changes).

I, however, have a hard time understanding how should I learn on the job? Assume you are given a deep model that you have not worked with / studied before, or working on a data pipeline that you have not worked with before.

How do you go about actually get the project done, while also learning it well? How do you prioritize? How do you divide your time into learning, doing, searching, etc? If you have any other strategies please do share it as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Any practical advice / resource is highly appreciated."

Tried to enjoy unemployment, but I got bored VERY fast and ended up finding another job that's still in oil and gas but on the environmental side that pays half as much. Boo. I'm not into that, but the company is nice (like a person is nice).  


Anyways, I was also accepted into Oregon State's MS in Data Analytics and I am dying to apply these things I'm learning to real life. I am hoping I can create my own ""internship"" through my existing employer instead of quitting and doing my degree fulltime. I think it will work out because the data are there (they actually collect quite a bit of data in the field) and I can see what can be done with it and they aren't touching it at all. Like lots of equipment failure stats (could pinpoint failing pipe parts for O&amp;G companies for example), cost-saving analysis REALLY needs to be done (tons of inefficiencies), and really the list goes on. I think could create tangible results for the company from a business building and money-saving standpoint. 

For context, the CEO seems to be VERY paranoid about technology. There is another partner in the company who I work under (and probably why he hired me) is more of the tech guy and he kind of has the last say in things but it's mostly catering to the CEO's anti-tech fears.... though we DO have decent systems for running ArcMaps, there are better ways of going about it. All 18 employees of us are doing the same kind of work and have to SHARE 3 computers that run ArcMaps. Let me tell you the frustration I feel waiting an hour and  to be the next ""first"" person to get in on one. UGH.  And just to be clear, finding inefficiencies and automating anything possible was a HUGE part of my last job, as well as data mining and some analytics, so seeing all these things and not being able to do anything about it is beyond frustrating. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - My new employer is missing out on a lot of revenue and has a lot of wasteful spending.  I think I can ask to create a new role for myself while I do my Masters Degree in Data Analytics and apply what I learn as I go to real-life scenarios. I already see opportunity in the company but the CEO is paranoid about tech. Has anyone gone this route? Done something similar? How do you prove it's needed without being cockblocked or stepping on someone else's toes?"

I work in a small data science team (5-ish people) at a large, non-tech company. We work with very large data sources and have solid infrastructure, but the technical skills of the team are very low. The team is all data scientists (myself included) with decent theoretical knowledge, but minimal experience with good coding/development practices.

I've worked as a (junior) software engineer in the past, and although I consider my knowledge to be pretty modest, it far exceeds that of the rest of the team. I'd like to introduce better practies to my current team, such as code reviews and writing tests, but I've never worked anywhere that had a great approach to development so I'm not sure how to go about it.

We mainly work on projects individually, that are usually unique and have little in common, so there's not much standardisation that can be done. We use git, but basically just commit straight to master, and most of our work is analsyis rather than anything that's productionised. It's rare for multiple people to work on the same codebase and even rarer to do so at the same time. We don't really use development methodologies like scrum/kanban, as we mostly work independently so people just manage their own work.

Any thoughts on where the best place to start would be? I'm not sure where to begin given the nature of our work and the low technical proficiency of the team. I want to help the rest of the team improve their coding, increase knowledge sharing, and generally work more efficiently. Thanks!"

The Data Science workflow starts with a business problem or objective that needs to be resolved. The data science team takes the problem at hand, and works through different stages to explore, clean and analyze the data to produce ML models that can solve business

1.   Data Cleaning turns the source “raw data” into a “clean” form. This takes a significant amount of time because most raw data is unclean, meaning steps need to be taken to improve the quality and develop it into a format that machines can interpret and learn from.

2.   Feature Engineering: Feature engineering is the process of taking a dataset and identifying explanatory variables  or “ features” that can be used to train a machine learning model for predictive analytics. Often, this involves merging data spread across multiple tables and gathered into a single table with rows containing the observations and features in the columns. This step is generally the most intensive part of the workflow, from a human perspective, as it requires a careful understanding of the problem and domain knowledge.

3.   Model Selection, Model Training and Deployment Model selection plays a crucial role in building good machine learning models. ML model selection requires selecting the best hyperparameters and algorithmic selection. A lot of model selection is now performed through automated software packages. Models are tested by exposing them to new data, providing an unbiased estimate of its performance.

4.   Exploratory Analysis Throughout the life of the data science project, the data science team will constantly sidestep from the main modeling pipeline to explore the data, try out various hypotheses."

We have 250,000 clients, 1,500 churn every month, that is, approximately 0.6% per month churn . It is very unbalanced.

I have the data for 18 months, that means that I have 18 times the database of 250,000 clients (4.5M rows) and marked the 27,000 clients who have churned those 18 months (1,500 churn \* 18 months).

Of those 4.5 million records, there are many repeat customers, since if they did not churn , they will remain in the database the following month.

My question is how do I build the dataset. I suppose I have to select the 27,000 cases that churned as the class to be predicted, but how do I go about selecting the records for the classes that did not churn?

I was thinking of transforming the non-churn class to unique registers, but what register do I take? The last record, the first, random?

I'm one of the developers that have been working on a package that enables faster hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models. We recognized that sklearn's GridSearchCV is too slow, especially for today's larger models and datasets, so we're introducing [tune-sklearn](https://github.com/ray-project/tune-sklearn). Just 1 line of code to superpower Grid/Random Search with

* Early Stopping
* Distributed Execution using Ray Tune

&amp;#x200B;

Installing [tune-sklearn](https://github.com/ray-project/tune-sklearn):

`pip install tune-sklearn scikit-optimize ray[tune]` or `pip install tune-sklearn scikit-optimize ""ray[tune]""` depending on your os.

Quick Example:

    from tune_sklearn import TuneSearchCV
    
    # Other imports
    import scipy
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier
    
    # Set training and validation sets
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=11000, n_features=1000, n_informative=50, 
                               n_redundant=0, n_classes=10, class_sep=2.5)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=1000)
    
    # Example parameter distributions to tune from SGDClassifier
    # Note the use of tuples instead if Bayesian optimization is desired
    param_dists = {
       'alpha': (1e-4, 1e-1),
       'epsilon': (1e-2, 1e-1)
    }
    
    tune_search = TuneSearchCV(SGDClassifier(),
       param_distributions=param_dists,
       n_iter=2,
       early_stopping=True,
       max_iters=10,
       search_optimization=""bayesian""
    )
    
    tune_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
    print(tune_search.best_params_)

All work on one branch or multiple? 
The problem is that we often have a scenario where a piece of work will
involve multiple steps, they're to be delivered in a pretty short space
of time, and changes are often requested later on (""*_can you filter by x%
instead of y% for z?*"", or whatever).

What has been done previously is that an issue is created for a piece of
analysis and everything is done there - the problem is that it's really damn
hard to manage all the commentary / defining scope / seeing what needs to be
done when everything is in one place (imo). So - instead of this - each
subtask of a particular piece of a project is broken out into a separate
issue, each with a particular deliverable.

This makes sense - but where it becomes a bit trickier is when I might want
to be able to borrow a bit of code from one issue to another, if they're all
siloed this makes things harder to do. So, I guess I would want to merge them
into the ""main issue"" repeatedly, I'm not really sure though.

So - in this scenario I have something like

```
├── master
│   ├── analysis_project
│   │   ├── task_1
│   │   └── task_2
│   │   └── task_3
│   │   └── task_4
│   │   └── task_5
...
```

And I'm asking - if you were to do something along these lines how would you
approach it?

You could have a branch off `analysis_project`, and just use the issues on
github to document the work being done on the tasks, but not actually have
branches for them.

Or, you could have a branch for `task_1`, `task_2`, `task_3` etc and when you
feel the task is complete (or near enough ish) merge it back into
`analysis_project`? How would you handle changes to the tasks in this setup?

Maybe there's an established workflow? That'd be nice.


# Edit

In response to a comment below the following context was given. 


________________


notebooks are used a lot but generally I try and use notebooks as a
luxurious `breakpoint()`, as soon as there's code that's code a reasonable
structure it's going into a module.

&gt; How you perform your analysis and reporting is going to have a huge influence

Yeah. So, a common scenario is that something will spin up very quickly (eg
&lt;24 hours notice and the project is live) and can have delivery within 2
weeks or so. Typically there can be exploratory stuff, data cleaning /
processing and then plotting/analyis of the data. Not expecting anything to
seem too unusual there, but what I don't know really is the way to structure
things for this.

Say the work comes in and it's `X Analysis`, then there's a story (issue)
created `Analysis of Y for X`, which contains an outline of the work that
needs to be done there might be a story created as:

```

Story S1

need to generate analysis for X, some data is located at &lt;somewhere&gt; and 
needs to be integrated into &lt;something&gt;, after which X needs EDA of &lt;y1 y2
y3&gt;, dead line for this is &lt;date&gt;.
```

Now - work could procede in a few ways afaik (there might be others too,
perhaps better!)

* 1 - create a branch `b0` for `S1`, and carry out all work within this branch
* 2 - Break the story out into separate tasks, and write up work for each of those tasks on the github issue, but keep all code within branch `b0`
* 3 - Break the story out into separate tasks, and write up work for each of those tasks on the github issue, for each task create a branch, so `b1 : gather data initial checks`, `b2 : integrate data into &lt;something&gt;`, `b3 : eda of &lt;y1 y2 y3&gt;`, once each task is completed merge into `b0`

Of the above I'm pretty sure that I don't like `1`, having *everything* on a single branch. For `2` and `3` I'm not too sure. `3` feels as though it would be the most ""textbook"", but there are scenarios where things are moving quickly and having *everything* on separate branches feels as though it might start getting a bit confusing, and if the client requests changes in something that's already been merged into `b0` then I guess I'd have to re-open, work on it, then merge it back in 🤔I'm not too sure really."

My family is torn up fighting over my brothers recent career decision and I need your advice.

My brother is 30 years old. He is an oil &amp; gas reservoir engineer with 5 years experience working at Royal Dutch Shell. He’s about to lose his job because his sector/industry has been hit hard by COVID19 and as a result his company is going through a massive wave of layoffs.

For as long as I can remember he has been infatuated with computer science/ coding, and it’s always been a regret of his that he did not pursue this career path when he was younger. He doesn’t have any formal training or experience in this, although he is somewhat of an amateur coder (self-taught in python and some stuff like that) but I really have no clue how good he is at this stuff.

This lay-off has got him thinking about a career shift. His plan is to enroll in a 3 year undergrad computer science program and get a bachelors degree so he can become a data scientist.

My mom doesn’t support his decision to go back to school and they won’t stop fighting about it. I’m trying keep the peace between them and stay neutral, but I’m leaning more towards my mom’s POV. The idea of going back to school and starting his career from scratch as a 34 year old fresh grad looking for entry level work in data science seems radical to me, at the very least questionable. Am I wrong? Is this a good idea?

I suggested as an alternative that he enroll in a 2 year master’s program instead. I don’t know if this is a good idea either TBH but at least it would be 1 less year and it seems more practical to me that he pursue an advanced degree and possibly compete for more senior positions, given his age. But he seems to think that even if he earned a masters degree he still lacks the work experience to compete at a more senior level, so might as well get the bachelors degree. He also says that he wants to get a full education in computer science starting with the fundamentals, which he would not get from a masters program.

1. Is it too late for my brother to become a data scientist? (I know it’s never too late for anything and I’d love for my brother to follow his dream and all that, but if we’re being practical about this- is it too late?)

2. If not, what is the best way for my brother to break into this industry?

I'm in over my head doing stuff I haven't studied for writing about a subject that is wayyy off track from my masters. But I'm committed now since I find it interesting.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I'll try to keep in short. I found [this](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327298996_Hardcore_Gamer_Profiling_Results_from_an_unsupervised_learning_approach_to_playing_behavior_on_the_Steam_platform) paper and want to replicate what they did but instead of using k-means I want to use DBSCAN. The data is retrieved from the Steam platform and they aim to cluster players on their behaviour, i.e. how likely is it for someone that only plays AAA games to also play Indie or F2P games.    
&amp;nbsp;  
 [This](https://imgur.com/a/uRUCmQY) is the dataset that I'm working with and what I presume they used in the paper as well. For now I'm only trying to find out if using DBSCAN, with best practice parameters, will give me the same clusters as they got.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Things I'm currently having trouble with:  
&amp;nbsp;  
1) How should I imagine multidimensional clustering to take place? Like, I can, in my mind, visualize how clustering works on up to three axis but anything more than that I don't get. This gives me a bit of trouble because I want to make sense of the features that are chosen for the clustering. Is this even something I'm supposed to get?  
&amp;nbsp;  
2) Does the 'appid' feature in my dataset make sense to use in clustering? Something about the numbers feels off as they're not all the same length but my understanding is not good enough to pinpoint what exactly my problem with it is.  
&amp;nbsp;   
3) I tried using DBSCAN but apparently it is not optimized for large datasets, instead I used HDBSCAN which, after running for twelve hours finally gave me a result. Has anyone worked with HDBSCAN in combination with a dataset the size of mine and can give me some pointers on how to set my parameters?  
&amp;nbsp;  
Like I said, not sure if this is Data Sciencey enough for this subreddit but didn't really know where else to post.

Each image in the dataset has been labelled once by employees of the client, in a quick ""eye ball"" sort of measurement. Consequently, there is considerable noise in the labels. The Bayes error for this problem is likely not zero, but I'm certain it's considerably lower than that of the workers.

  
I'd like to somehow compare the performance of my model to that of the workers in estimating the *actual* ground truth, or some proxy thereof.

  
One idea I've had is having workers relabel parts of the dataset, and comparing the error of the new labels against the error of the model, assuming the old labels as ground truth. If I'm not mistaken, this test has the possibility of showing that the model is at least as good as the workers, but I don't think it can show that the model outperforms the workers.

I even tried using bigrams/trigrams - creating ngrams of the default text without removing stopwords or lemmatizing creates topics that are just as useless, but if I do remove words then I have ngrams that are not accurate because those words don't actually appear together.

This might be a long post, so thank you for taking the time to read this :)

I just graduated with a Sociology degree from a college in U.S, but discovered the field of data science in my senior year. I know a lot of people have told me that I might not need to go back to school, I can learn on my own to get a data science job with SQL, Python, but because I am from South East Asia (data science jobs are not very big here), I am hoping to go to college again to get a degree to be able to get a job abroad to work in the future. It's much easier to get a job abroad/work visa in e.g Canada, Australia etc if I graduate from there. I am wondering if anyone can give me any advice on countries/universities that would offer a second bachelors, masters or diploma that would allow me to learn more? I am hoping to avoid the U.S. because the work visa is a bit difficult to obtain.

I have been stuck on trying to find schools and been quite stressed about it... The amount of money that I can afford to spend on the whole degree (including accommodation, fees, tuition etc) is USD $60k-65k... since I have already spent a fortune on my current undergrad...

I would like to ask for advice on how to use recommendation letter from my post graduate professor. A few months ago I graduated from my master program of computer/data science from my university and I am looking for a job in the data science field. In the last semester, I have the privilege to work with the professors from the school's computer science department and are publishing a paper to ICML this year. The professor seems happy about my work and agree to write an recommendation letter for me, he even said he was willing to have one of his colleagues who is famous in the field to sign on the recommendation letter. So I start thinking what the best way to utilize this opportunity is to help on my current job search. 

There are two options that I can think of right now as below:

* Ask the professor to write the recommendation letter on my LinkedIn profile

The benefit of this option is that the letter can be viewed publicly by recruiters and HR managers and the value of the letter can be re-used and last long. However, I will not get the endorsement from my professor's famous colleague.

* Ask the professor to write the recommendation letter to a specific company that I apply for

In this solution, I will be able to get the signature from my professor and the famous person's name on the letter which increase the letter's value, but I can only use it once. If I didn't admitted to the company, the letter basically goes useless.

I am relatively inexperienced on this recommendation letter subject and open to any suggestion and advice, if you see any other better way to utilize the professor's recommendation letter, feel free to let me know.

I'd really appreciate.

Thank you!"

If this isn't the right subreddit to post this please point me towards a more appropriate one.

tldr: My team's codebase is a mess of unorganized and poorly documented jupyter notebooks/.py files and I am trying to figure out the best method/way of managing all of it in a more standardized way.

As the title states, how do you all manage your company/team's codebase/tools? I recently got hired in a healthcare company as a statistical modeling analyst and to say the least - their unorganized as hell when it comes to their code. In the past, the position I have was handled by one person and basically just held all their code/juptyer notebooks in their personal directory; I am talking about \~2.5 years worth of ad hoc analysis, analytic tools (finished and unfinished), jupyter notebooks that outline several major processes. There are also some major production tools he made that are stored in his folder without any real meaningful way of doing some version control.

Then about 8 months ago, they hired my co-worker (lets call him Bob) who didn't have any coding background and learned by just re-using the first guy's work. He accessed/still accesses it through the first guy's folder, but copied it over to his own personal folder and added a bunch of edits. Well, the first guy leaves to Google and he leaves this mess without much documentation (I am talking even without much comments within the notebooks, let alone a README file).

Fast-forward to a month ago, I come in and am shadowing Bob and he is jumping back and forth across multiple (read: almost a dozen) different folders at a time trying to find the right jupyter notebook to use, has at least 5 untitled jupyter notebooks opened at once doing several things (sometimes working on the same project across multiple notebooks), and overall just a very messy and poorly documented workflow. Outputs get put in not a standardized fashion, everything just seems like a mess. He even confuses himself sometimes on which notebook is working on what.

I myself am starting to build tools/automate parts of the job, but I don't want to fall in the same habit of just storing it all on my personal directory and have files (.py) floating around everywhere. Luckily this position gives me a lot of freedom to spend time improving on this aspect of the job. So to return back to the original reason for the post - what is the best way to go about this? Should I try pushing for a github for our team in order to organize everything? Or is there a better alternative? My background is astrophysics so I don't have much experience doing version control or managing codebases, but since I'm planning on being in the position for a while, I dont want to have a bajillion notebooks open at once."

In essence, it needs to take a vendor name, and output what category it falls into. Categories include, but are not limited too: Transportation, Legal, IT, Construction, Staffing, Manufacturing, or Maintenance &amp; Installation.

So far, I've considered two strategies.

* *Option A*
Using a google search API to scrape the top ten search results for that vendor, build or utilize an existing NLP algorithm to match the Google output with a category from a pre-built table of categories. 

* *Option B*
Build a table of supplier names and their associated categories using previous data, and then fuzzy match new supplier data as best I can with the pre-built table. This one is tricky as ""Delta Air Inc,"" ""D Airlines,"" ""Delta"" would all need to be matched to the same supplier, but not ""D Air""--that's an air conditioning company. Additionally, it would be added too as needed---if the supplier isn't present, either manually input their data or utilize something like *Option A*. 

Looking over the two options, I see now that they may be one and the same, but two different levels in the hierarchy of the tool. 

Either way, I wanted to see what the smart users of this subreddit would suggest. How would you tackle it? Any algorithms that could simplify things? Is there a tool out there you know about that accomplishes this very goal?"

Hoping to tap the hivemind of Reddit for this question.

For those of you who manage data science managers/people leaders, or are part of interview panels for data science managers: are there different expectations of technical aptitude between people manager candidates and ICs who apply for \[senior/principal\] data science roles?

Why I'm asking this question: I'm a people manager myself at a mid-sized company in the Bay Area, with a Masters in Data Science and 4+ years of leadership experience (in industry for 15). I am simply not as ""in the weeds"" as my team members are... nor is there an expectation by my leadership teams that I code or query every day; while this frustrates me, I continue to receive praise for helping my team do better work, asking the right questions, ensuring they are staying on track, etc. 

However, I have applied to other manager positions, and my technical interviews have been VERY technical: I've had a total of 10-15 technical-round interviews in the last 6-8 months. It's clear that I pass the leadership scrutiny test, but I continue to miss expectations on the technical front. In short, I'm rusty. 

I understand that teams and companies have different needs... but are companies really expecting senior managers and/or directors to be able to perform technically at the same level as ICs? Or is the truth of the matter that I--and others in my situation--simply have to review like crazy, even at this level? Are VPs asked technical questions as well? 

Hope that wasn't too rant-like. Would love to hear thoughts.

I've taken schooling for this my entire life to be honest. It's always been mathematical and statistical, and in my second bout of education, focused more on computing to apply this math.

But for data scientists we have to know so much spanning different fields. **From math, statistics, to optimization, to data structures, and algorithms, to your specific programming language gotchas, more advanced statistical + computing algorithms including ML/DL/ etc...**

How can someone possibly remember all of this and retain all the different sources of knowledge in memory? It's not like I have not been taught this and didn't know the specifics before. But it's never efficiently stored in memory. For some very common basics, I have to look up and remember how they work again.

1. So take linear regression for example something I've studied multiple times before. It's the most basic. I can right now tell you the general formula of the equation, and what it's trying to do. But if someone were to ask me right now to explain the internals of gradient descent (DESPITE taking multiple courses that taught/used this concept), I wouldn't be able to tell you. I can tell you the gist, and I have some visualization of my mind of the process, in that it's essentially trying to look for the direction of highest negative change.  For logistic regression, I can tell you its for classification and that it uses MLE to solve, but would have to look up again the implementation. For example, I don't remember how MLE works but know its related to probability.
2. If someone were to then ask me to explain something that involves more computing and computer science. So say something about bytes, binary representation, how it's used. I can give you the general gist that it's used to represent/store data in an efficient manner. But that's it. I can't give you more specifics to that, and would probably have to learn it all again with more details.
3. With data structures/algorithms, despite learning it before, I can give you a general gist of what they involve, but that's it. For example, a dictionary is cool because it allows easy key lookup because it uses hash representation. A list is ordered and is iterable, etc... I understand the general concept of time complexity but probably will struggle if asked to figure out whether something represents exponential time. Just the other day, had to refresh on the differences between hashable and mutable, etc...

My point is, there's just so many different fields we have to have working knowledge on. And don't even get me started with more http, web servers, etc...  It's something I haven't been taught and haven't had the chance to learn yet as I'm still trying to remember, learn, maintain everything else. How do people REMEMBER all of this? I had to look up the basics of hypothesis testing the other day, as I remembered its gist, but not how to implement it. Is this normal?"

I started as a Business Analyst 12+ years ago in a startup based out of the midwestern USA right after undergrad degree in Engineering. Data Scientist as a title didn't exist back then, but I still did a bunch of statistical modeling in SAS. 

Later, moved to the tech division of a Fortune 50 company in the Bay Area, again as a BA. Then moved to a FAANG company as a DS, which opened the door for other FAANGs, so I spent time in two more FAANGs in various roles before moving to a bay area unicorn. In this time I also finished a masters in my employer's dime.

Had promotions in every company I worked in, except for one in the middle because of my tenure being too short. Here are some tips to aspiring and current data scientists.

1. **Getting hired:** I'll admit, I got ridiculously lucky. I don't think the 21 year old me would get hired at a tech company right now. I didn't have a portfolio, no experience in DS/Analytics/Statistical Modeling, and no family connections in the industry. A friend who was a year ahead of me in college was already working for the startup as an Engineer and since he knew I was ""mathematically gifted"" (his words, not mine), he got me the job. I learned everything on the job from SQL, SAS (yes, I'm that old), and even Excel. However, with DS and ML becoming the new gold rush, companies, especially tech companies, doubly so for FAANGs are spoiled for choice. So it's important to stand out. I've done a lot of hiring for FAANGs, so I feel like I can pass on some advice. As with anything on the internet, please take this with a grain of salt because this is only based on my experience, and isn't meant to be universal. For folks who're fresh out of school/still in school - internships help a lot. But in the absence of industry experience, the thing I look for is your ability to solve open ended problems using DS/ML. Kaggle competitions like predicting the survivors of Titanic have been done a million times over and don't show anything that I haven't already seen. So pick a problem in a domain that you think is interesting and do something DS related, like building a cool Data Viz, or building a model to predict/explain something, etc. For the more experienced folks, highlight the impact of your previous work. This leads neatly into my second point.

2. **Impact not method:** Unless you’re working in the research arm of tech companies (MSR, Google Brain, FAIR), or in Academia, your boss’s boss likely doesn’t care about what method you used to solve the problem. Just what the impact to the company was. So stop focusing on methodology and start focusing on how you’re helping the business. Remember that you’ve not been hired to write SQL and Python, you’ve been hired to help do one of: (a) make more money for the company, (b) cut costs for the company - which also includes helping others in the company be more effective by building internal tools. However, it’s relatively unheard of to have an entry level DS being given an open ended problem and being asked to solve it, you will likely have to rely on your manager and/mentors to do that for you. But over time, the expectation is for you to become more and more independent. Which would require you to constantly learn new things and adapt to change. Keep in mind that this doesn't mean you should stop paying attention to using the right methodology for the right problem, but that when you're telling your story, focus on the impact.

3. **Getting promoted:** Unless you’re exceptionally talented or exceptionally lucky, promotions won’t happen without asking for it. Have open and honest conversations with your manager about the expectations for the next level and chart a course to get there. Ask for feedback and continuously improve. As you grow in your career, especially past the *Senior* level, your ability to influence your peers, and leaders matters a lot more than your technical competency. So identify areas where you can exercise that muscle. It’s very different muscle from being a technically capable data scientist. A mistake I see a lot of young Data Scientists making is relying on the idea that more work will get you promoted. It won’t, at least after a point. What it takes to go from L3 (entry level) DS to L4 (the very next level) is very different from what it takes to get to L5 (Senior) and above. 

4. **When moving companies, know the levels:** I got seriously burnt in my last role. I misunderstood their leveling system and took a role at a level below my expected level, became seriously resentful at seeing people with half my experience being in the level above me, eventually ended up leaving because I thought it was a clear case of bait and switch. So do your research, talk to people in the company if you can. levels.fyi is a great resource to understand level equivalence across companies.

5. **Find a mentor, then mentor others:** If your company has many Data Scientists, find someone who you look up to and ask them to be your mentor. Go prepared to your mentorship sessions, ask pointed questions and ask for their advice. More importantly follow-up with them and show how their advice helped you. Once you're comfortable enough, pass on the favor to those who come after you. If you're the only DS in a company - which I've seen cases of, find industry mentors. I've seen many forums for you to find DS mentors. If nothing works, reach out to people in the industry on LinkedIn asking for mentorship. More than half the time, they will accept.

6. **Strike a balance between technical skills and soft skills:** As I mentioned above, the further you get in your career, the less important your technical ability becomes. That doesn’t mean you can afford not to know the basics, it just means you’re valued more for your ability to influence your peers, stakeholders, and leaders than your ability to write beautiful code. So learning after a point has to span both the (almost orthogonal) axes of technical ability and soft skills. You cannot afford to be lax on learning new techniques because the world around us is changing. I started my job knowing only SQL and SAS. Then my toolkit was SQL, SAS and R. I only picked up Python ~2-3 years ago. I’m sure it’s not gonna end here. Learning is a lifelong endeavor in a field like this. At the same time, I was also learning to be a better negotiator, and a better leader. 

7. **Focus on quality of life:** Remember that I have had over 12 years to do this, and I’m not even half-way into my career. Careers span 30+ years. Learn to take a breather, take vacations, take breaks and disconnect from it all once in a while. An endless rat-race will leave you burned out and unable to focus. It happened to me 5-6 years into my career where I felt overwhelmed everyday. It’s not good for you in the long run. I know this point sounds contradictory to everything I’ve said above about constantly having to learn, but it really isn’t if you put it into a 30+ year time-span. You don’t have to be the best analyst, best machine learning engineer, the best story teller, and the best leader in year 2. You can pick and choose what you want to learn based on your environment and what’s needed immediately.

8. **Don’t gatekeep, don’t look down on others, help those who ask:** Nothing bothers me more than seeing young Data Scientists/ML Engineers looking down on Data Analysts, calling them SQL monkeys. A lot of them also look down on people who do sales and marketing. Remember, even in companies like FAANG, your ability to get paid ultimately depends on the marketing and sales people’s ability to sell the things you build. Work with everyone, help anyone who will ask, and be nice to everyone you come across. Being known as the person who is “nice to work with” will take you much farther than being a 10x engineer (a term I’ve come to loathe).

I’m happy to provide proof of my career to the mods, but also worried about getting doxxed. Feel free to ask me any questions, I’ll be happy to answer them (within reason)."

&amp;#x200B;

About 4 years ago I took a career sidestep from an oil/gas science role to data science (with a data analyst stepping stone in the middle). I am now a senior data scientist with a mid-sized medical technology company in their R&amp;D division.

&amp;#x200B;

However, there are five slightly concerning issues with my current role/situation:

1) I am the only formally titled 'Data Scientist' in the company. (There are other's who easily have the knowledge and experience to be one but are put under the 'Stats' umbrella)

2) The company's DS capabilities are very much in their infancy. (But one of their key focuses is to change that)

3) It is the kind of company that doesn't seem to know what a data scientist does. (Although, thankfully, they have given me a huge amount of flexibility and autonomy to get things done)

4) The term 'Senior' in this company appears to be scaled differently to other companies I've been in. (I think everyone who has come in so far has at least a 'senior' role!)

5) I never had any formal data science learning/training and most of what I've learned has been on the job or what I'm picking up from ESL and PRML. (I come from a Maths/Natural Sciences background so I like to think I have the mind to pick DS/ML concepts up quickly)

&amp;#x200B;

So far my role has been more of a data engineering one and I've spent the past year consolidating the company's data, getting teams to move away from storing data in spreadsheets, and coordinating with the IT department to set up a data warehouse which has, so far, been very successful. I'm now in a position to start analysing data and building models to help the business. (Although I'm a little concerned about my lack in breath of knowledge of DS/ML)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really enjoying the job and I have no plans to leave but I always like to have an escape route and I worry that I've managed to oversell myself into a senior DS role. I feel like I'm under-qualified to transition into another senior DS role (should anything happen to my role or the company) and that my current DE work has taken time away from my development.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is expected of a senior data scientist and what should I be focusing my development on for now? Should I be expanding my knowledgebase of modelling techniques? Or managerial skills? Or something else?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"

I'm an undergrad experimenting with ML in Timeseries predictions right now. I collected data of tomatoes yielded per day in our home kitchen garden over 83 days, and decided to try and forecast it.

I used a simple linear regression model, feeding in 5 values as features and the next value as a the label. Please see the result [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18niGw7SnZ3QI2npQ7QMfFbDpH9rh7SPk/view?usp=drivesdk). The vertical red line at 60 is the training/testing split value. 

I have a few questions regarding this:
1)  Why does it seem that my predicted curve is leading the original data by roughly 5 time steps (same as my window size)?

2) What else should I try to achieve better results?

I want to do a project but I'm not sure if it's really viable neither which path I should take to try and solve this.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a dataset with numerous incidents from different places and their risk classification. For example:

&gt;Incident: ""John stumbled and fell down the stairs""  
&gt;  
&gt;Risk: Severe  
&gt;  
&gt;Warehouse: A  
&gt;  
&gt;Date: 2020-07-11

&gt;\---  
&gt;  
&gt;Incident: ""Mary left the door open""  
&gt;  
&gt;Risk: Low  
&gt;  
&gt;Warehouse: B  
&gt;  
&gt;Date: 2020-07-10 

&amp;#x200B;

My idea is to compile the incidents by warehouse by week and give a probability of incidents happening in each warehouse for every risk.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Warehouse A  
&gt;  
&gt;Probability of low risk incidents next week: 60%  
&gt;  
&gt;Probability of severe risk incidents next week: 30%

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm not really sure how to get around this problem. It's not really text classification because I know the classification of every report (risk). Is there a way to use this dataset and get any prediction for the next week?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for any help!"

Being a nonconfrontational Midwesterner, I said we're fine then I went home and wrote an email telling him I wanted to be treated with respect and that I wasn't happy with how he treated me during that project. 3 weeks passed and we had a meeting a few minutes ago to discuss my email.

For a few months now, I've been having some sort of a career + future anxiety. I started with data science around 2 and a half years ago in my first year of bachelor's because I really liked data handing at the time. I loved working with messy data and I loved the feeling when I successfully visualised something. Then I learnt about Kaggle and to this day, I always do projects or analysis from there. I've even been able to build a small community of kagglers who support and lift each other.

With all that, I started applying for internships. I'd get rejected initially but I though that that's just part of the journey. I did get a lot of internships and have been able to meet a lot of people. I further moved to domains like machine learning and artificial intelligence and I've been able to get some research papers published as well. I see here, that recruiters love the candidates that can talk to non-tech people and explain their approach and results. I feel like I can do that, I love to write everything that I do as if I were explaining it to a 5 year old. I've also had the opportunity to work with researchers from all around the world.

Yet, I feel like I am not good at interviews and screenings. Or am I just aiming too high? After 2 and a half years dedicated to this field, I often get flustered with screening tasks, I am unable to help people with their doubts, it takes me ages to understand code etc. Most of the internships I have got are through connections and networking on linkedin. I just feel like I have been faking it. I'm not bragging but I have a really nice resume with good internships, good projects, research papers, but I feel like that's just a show because I really don't know stuff. Am I overreacting?

Hi everyone, the organisation I work for is creating its first-ever data-position '***Head of Data &amp; Analytics***'. There is a big data literacy/maturity deficit within the organisation and it would be this person's role to begin to change this. Salary is not massive so the role is open to someone who hasn't been in a senior data-position before but is up to the challenge. The organisation I work for is rather complex as it is a charity with social enterprises so it combines impact/social work, fundraising and commercial activity.

I've drafted the job role below, however, I'm hoping you kind people might be able to help me determine what skills/knowledge would be classed as essential to be able to do this and any other pointers in what the right candidate should look like (remember this is a low/mid salary position due to limited funding available).

\----

# Job Purpose

There has been identified a lack of clear data structure and process within the organisation and confirmation that data needs to be managed, retained, analysed and stored with greater control and routine. The role of the Data &amp; Analytics Lead would be to:

* To define, own and implement a group-wide data strategy and ensure the strategic vision for data architecture is met and maintained by working with the CEO (in line with their 3-year strategic vision) and a range of Stakeholders including Department Heads, Managers and Support Workers.
* To develop and promote a central database architecture that aids the organisation in achieving its strategic goals
* Work with various teams throughout the organisation to provide analysis and valuable insights to unlock opportunities, drive data-informed business decisions and to make a positive impact on our service users.

# Key Objectives/Responsibilities

**Infrastructure**

* Partner with leadership and peers to understand report requirements, map and document existing business processes, evaluating output requirements and formats and ensure consistency across teams
* Implement and administer the large CRM database initiative and provide database user support.

&amp;#x200B;

**Analysis**

* Effectively use data to tell stories, communicate key insights through internal reports, presentations and dashboards to drive business decisions.
* Define and share key business performance indicators with the leadership team.
* Analysis of our customer and donor base to help our retail and fundraising teams understand our supporters.
* Help get the most out of our website, content and social platforms - by understanding and helping in the optimization of customer journeys and marketing/advertising campaign performance

&amp;#x200B;

**Management**

* Help to drive the data strategy group-wide.
* Work with the with leadership &amp; management teams across the group to understand their requirements &amp; data sources, set priorities based on analysis and results to implement and optimise fundraising, impact and commercial processes and solutions
* Work with the leadership teams to build dashboards and KPI monitoring reports for providing insights to enable better planning and performance monitoring across the organisation.
* Work closely with various teams within the organisation to gain a holistic view of customers, trends and competitors

\----

I appreciate that this may be asking a lot from one person, especially on a low/mid-range salary but it is what we need and all we can afford. I'm hoping that it will be a great working experience for the person taking the role who will see it as an opportunity to develop their role and get their feet wet in a senior data position. With that, there will also be patience and expectation for a lot of on the job learning, that this will be a long process and the person filling the role won't magically be able to implement/fix everything listed above within their first year in the role. We see this as a two-year+ journey to data maturity.

&amp;#x200B;

**What are the bare minimum technical/non-technical skills/knowledge I should be looking for?**

&amp;#x200B;

Also for extra context the organisation is 6 years old, and is looking to implement salesforce but does not have a CRM/central database yet.

How does one get there? Of course it doesnt happen over night but is there a general guideline on how to get there or advice on what one should do? Feeling really stuck these days...

I'm currently working as a Data Scientist Coop but can really see my flaws and areas that i need improvement. I feel as though my mindset and toolset right now as a ""data scientist"" is more like...script kitty/plug in and play...very narrow minded. I lack the ability to think creatively with the data I have to work with and really struggle to develop innovative or intelligent ideas/thoughts with the data.

Hi all,

So for work I analyze course survey data for professors looking to potentially redesign their courses and take them from an in-person lecture based class to a fully online self-regulated learning based class. So I'm the person who is doing all the data wrangling and am doing it in R. This is my first time ever having a job or doing something like this for such a scale. Everybody else uses SPSS but I don't know how to use SPSS and I use my personal Mac for work and SPSS just does not want to work on my Mac. Besides, R is better (but I'm the only person on my team of people that knows how to use it) .... Anyways,

Right now we have a project where we are analyzing Fall 2018, Spring 2019, Fall 2019, and Spring 2020 course survey data (labeled FA18, SP19, FA19, and SP20 respectively) for four classes: a math class (MA 101), a business class (BUS 563), a computer science class (CSC 362), and a biochemistry class (BCH 231).

Within each semester, there are three surveys administered to the class uniformly across the semester-- one at the beginning (BGN), the middle (called MID), and the end (END -- really creative I know). We call these time points ""phases"". So now, for each of the four classes, I have a grand total of 12 surveys (4 semesters worth of data x 3 surveys administered total).

Let's talk about the surveys. I wish I could say each survey asks the exact same questions, but they don't. Stuff that exists in one of the MA 101 surveys might not exist in say, the BCH 231 survey and even for one particular course there are some questions that are only asked at a certain phase. This is to be expected though, however, I have a few tasks:

1. Download these course survey results (whether it's the BGN survey, MID survey, or END survey) from Qualtrics in SPSS, then bring the SPSS data into R (my boss just sends me the SPSS data hence why I worded it this way. I don't have access to Qualtrics and I don't use SPSS on my Mac since it acts all wonky). To bring in SPSS data I use the haven package which works fantastically :)
2. Clean this data. There are a lot of variables here, but these variables are literally questions with pre-defined labels. A common question we ask in any of these surveys is ""describe your interest in this subject matter before, during, or after \[depending on the phase\] of this course."" This question we just call ""Interest1"" or something. Things like that (if that makes any sense). So part of the data cleaning process involves me using the reshape package to go in and manually go through every single variable and either rename it or tell R to exclude it from the final data set. This is a very time consuming and tedious process might I add. The variables that come to mind are things like ""StudentIDNum"", ""ResponseID"", ""First Name"", ""Last Name"", ""Email Address"", ""Year in School"", ""Interest1"", etc. I also have to change missing values from -99 to N/A for each of these variables in all of this data. If someone could be as so kind to tell me how to do this that would be so wonderful :) This data is also mostly all Likert Scale data. So a lot of my data is just columns of integers between 1 and 5. Not all of it is though, but I would like it to be. Some of my data is like ""Definitely no"", ""sometimes no"", ""maybe"", ""sometimes yes"", and ""yes"". Know what I mean? I would also love to know how to convert variables with responses like this to integers between 1 and 5 please and thank you :)
3. Now once I have cleaned all my data and spit out a cleaned CSV file for each of the surveys administered for the students to take (which, might I add, don't always all have a 100% response rate -- again, to be expected though), my task is to then merge each of the three survey results into one combined data set for a given semester. From here, then I take each of these merged data sets for one semester, and put them all together so that way for a particular course, say MA 101, we have one massive combined data set that consists of a bunch of survey results across time: FA18\_BGN FA18\_MID FA18\_END SP19\_BGN SP19\_MID SP19\_END ... SP20\_BGN SP20\_MID SP20\_END. Something like that, does that make sense?
4. Now once I have one massive merged/combined data set for each of these four courses, then ultimately I have to merge all of these data sets into one super massive combined data set.

So ultimately my question is how do I do this? Do I just use the merge() function in R? This function can only take two data sets at a time though and also within this function there is the ""by ="" parameter which, to my best understanding, tells R by what variables do you want to merge by? I was doing by intersect(dataset 1, dataset 2) but apparently that's not what my boss wants. He wants literally all of it merged together whether someone responded to all three surveys in a given course or only did just one. And also because there isn't really likely an overlap between students across semesters for a given course or any of the other classes (save maybe for the MA 101 course and the CSC 362 course), how do I handle merging this? Should I tell my boss that what he wants isn't feasible?

I apologize for asking so many questions and sounding like a confused idiot, but well, that's exactly what I am. This is my first big boy stats job because I'm in grad school for statistics so I'm brand spanking new to it (background is pure math -- undergrad and masters in it) and just finished my first year. I've never really had to clean data sets before or do any of that kind of work and I'm working with some education and psychology researchers and people this summer which is why they all use SPSS. Because we have a work from home order though I'm using my Mac to do all my work on and I'm actually using my brand new one I just got. The MacBook Pro I was previously using (and had been using for the past 6 years) died about 4 weeks ago and since all the apple stores are closed between my summer courses and work I had to get a new one. I tried a work one for a bit but I couldn't download anything (R/R Studio) and I needed a new personal one anyways so I got this one. My old one had a trial of SPSS on it though and Jesus did that thing never want to freaking work. It always froze on me and made everything so slow. Plus I want to refine my R skills and get good at it (mostly I've just been using SAS this whole first year -- ew, but, well, apparently our school likes to use SAS for some reason idk).

But yeah, I don't know how to best join these data sets and account for the lack of complete responses, and I'm just feeling overwhelmed because nobody else on my team knows how to program in R well and I'm super new to all this statistics and data stuff so I'm just feeling super stressed about it all. This is why I'm turning to r/datascience to help. Thank you for taking the time to read all this and helping a poor grad student out! It really does mean a lot and I am very appreciative of your time. Thanks again."

I have been searching on Google for the answer but since I'm pretty new to handling this much data, I hope someone more experienced can give me some advice.

Basically I have around 300-400GB of csv up on Google Drive right now that I want to analyze. I upload it there since I don't have enough space in my laptop. 

I am currently unemployed and this is sort of a passion project only (I can't aford AWS/Azure for it) so I'm only looking for free program that can help me interact with the data. So after looking around, I'm thinking about using Spark on Google Colab to deal with it.

I have never used or learnt Spark before, so can anyone tell me if this is even possible? I see the Disk storage in Colab is 100GB something so if I merge all my cvs into a single dataframe, will that exceed Colab storage? For now I guess I just want to run some simple multivariate regressions on those data so if there's better way to do it than merging every single csv together, I would appreciate the suggestion. Thank you"

I have passed this week the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate) from Google. I could not find a lot of feedback here about people taking it so I am writing this post hoping it will help people who want to take it. 

The exam contains 5 problems to solve, part of the code is already written and you need to complete it.  It can last up to 5 hours, you need to upload your ID/Passport and take a picture using your webcam at the beginning, but no one is going to monitor what you do during those 5 hours. You do not need to book your exam beforehand, you can just pay and start right away. There is no restriction on what you can access to during the exam.

I strongly recommend you to take [Coursera's TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice) as the questions in the exam are similar to the exercises you can find in this course. I had previous experience with TensorFlow but anyone with a decent knowledge of Deep Learning and finishes the specialization should be capable of taking the exam.

I would say the big drawback of this exam is the fact you need to take it in Pycharm on your own laptop. I suggest you do the exercises from the Specialization using Pycharm if you haven't used it before (I didn't and lost time in the exam trying to get basic stuff working in Pycharm). I don't have GPU on my laptop and also lost time while waiting for training to be done (never more than \~10mins each time but it adds up), so if you can get GPU go for it! In my opinion it would have make more sense to do the exam in Google Colab... 

Last advice: for multiple questions the source comes from [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets), spend some time understanding the structure of the objects you get as a result from load\_data , it was not clear for me (and not very well documented either!), that's time saved during the exam.

I would be happy to answer other questions if you have some!"
