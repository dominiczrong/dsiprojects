,datascience,"I wrote this post 6 months ago, and I know that the world has changed a lot and a lot people are looking for a job now. I wanted to repost in case it was helpful to anyone. 


I work for a midsized SaaS company as an embedded and thought I’d share what we are really looking for! 
* **SQL**: For some reason, this is a huge hole. 90% of DS is data cleaning and manipulation. Don't just know the syntax; know how to manipulate raw product tables to get the data you want, and be able to defend your pulls to business line owners and stakeholders when they ask why you're showing them what you're showing them.  
* **Logic and self deduction skills**: I'm not just talking about math-like logic. This includes business and interpersonal logic as well. For example, why is this person asking this? What is the “whole board” they’re seeing?
* **Ability to check your data and findings against the product output / business situation**: How do you know what you pulled is right? That your findings make sense? Do your numbers hold water against someone who knows the product data and inter-workings inside and out? Can you explain your models?
* **Non technical stakeholder communication skills**: This includes presentations, building rapport and relationships, managing up, managing different attitudes, understanding perspectives, understanding how to ask questions and listen between the lines, building strong daily partnerships
* **Business strategy skills**: Now that you’ve completed this project, now what? What does this mean for the business? How do you see the whole board and make a recommendation that fits in? 
* **Grit and attitude**: AKA the ability to wrangle through messy problem,  messy data, and with messy relationships and politics. Know how to get through the mess, how to self problem solve, and when to call in favors. Also, have a willingness to do grunt work, like write SQL, or figure out what the product data is, how it is produced, and wtf the engineers were thinking when they structured the product in that way.
* **Politicking and relationship building**: understand how to work with product, biz line owners, execs, etc to solve problems. Have a strong willingness to HELP OTHERS! 
* **Tableau / data viz in some way**: be able to clearly relay your findings, with ""like I'm 5"" attitude, to people who are not comfortable with even basic bar charts or graphs. You should be able to look at a graph at a glance and consume what it is telling you. 

Then... python/R, special packages, math, modeling, etc. 

I see so many people worried about x language or Y package, where I actually think those are relatively easy to learn. The soft skills aren’t taught in school and are VERY important - and the hardest to find! 

Honestly, analysts and data scientists don't get to do the cool stuff all the time. There is a lot of boring stuff that is easy to do, technically. I built a dashboard the other day that took me maybe 4-6 hours from start (coding) to finish, and people falling over themselves in excitement. It wasn't fancy, but it made it VERY easy for them to get what they needed, quickly. 

What do other hiring managers think?

**ADDITONS:**
* When all else is equal, we hire based on culture and team fit, and willingness to learn. **Attitude and fit often outweigh technical skills!**

* The requisite mastery level certainly does depend on the job level. For more junior level candidates, I understand when you haven’t developed those yet... but how is your attitude? Do you think you know everything bc you have the hard skills down? Or do you recognize that you are just starting out and the soft skills are what you need to learn? 

You’d be surprised at how many people graduate with a MS or PhD, but have no work experience, and think they deserve senior level roles. Sorry... drop the ego, you only know a little bit of what you actually need to know to be successful. 

* Re: how to convey this in an interview / resume, or how to ask interview questions - you ask performance based questions. “Tell me about a time you partnered with a non technical stakeholder to solve a business problem”. 

Talk about how you solved the business problem first, then about the tools you used to get there. I like hearing about cool stuff, but I also need to know you can do the basic stuff and the soft skills REALLY well. 

* We hire for a well rounded team. Everyone has a different background. Not everyone is going to know everything. That is ok.

But any ideas are welcome, I need some inspiration. Thanks :)&lt;/p&gt;

,datascience,"I'm on a quest to become a Data Scientist, however in all honesty my Maths and Stats arent the best - and it's really worrying me.

Going back to university isn't really an option at this point.

I do have some stats knowledge, such as satistical tests, inferential and descriptive statistics, and so on. For Maths, I know very little. 

Doesn't help that I'm spending almost all my time trying to bridge the gap between beginner and intermediate Python, learn SQL, take part in Kaggle competitions, understand machine learning, revise data structures &amp; algorithms (the list is honestly endless) all within the limited free time I have after work and on weekends.

So, I'm just wondering if it's (A) feasible to self teach oneself Maths &amp; Stats, and (B) how best to go about this (any good online courses?) especially when there are so many other areas that need focus?

,datascience,"Recently I was working on an end to end solution for a client. Since my company is AWS Partnered, we extensively use Sagemaker for deployment.

For anyone who uses sagemaker, Amazon gives a lot of different options for building model image ( everything is containerized in sagemaker - model, algorithm) - Bring your own script (BYOS), Standard built-in algorithms, and also using Sagemaker Docker Templates.

It was confusing to me at first, since there were many ways to reach the solution, but all of them very messy and less documented.

So I came across this framework - [BentoML](https://www.bentoml.ai) , which uses an abstraction above Flask and Docker.

I would recommend using this framework - lightweight, minimalistic, and easy to code and understand. It bridges the gap between model building and production.

,datascience,"Hi Everyone,

My department is hiring a new manager who will have 4 direct reports. Three of those will be analyst style roles and the last one is more of an entry level ""data science"" role. The manager will work with customers on occasion as well. The trouble I have found with other managers hired into this department is that they lack a technical background and are not able to check the work of or guide the entry level analyst employees that might have issues with SQL or how to approach a problem. 

What questions would you ask someone to get a manager that might be able to guide the ship a bit? I was thinking 3-4 ""technical"" questions and 1-2 situational questions. My current thoughts were 1) Explain a scenario where it might be advantageous to use a statistical approach like linear regression over a machine learning approach like random forest. 2) Could you give a brief description of database normalization? 3) What is the difference between a SQL WHERE clause and a HAVING clause?

,datascience,"I come from a more statistical background but I was in BME before that and I just can’t see it. 

Yea I understand Python has scikit and Tensorflow/Keras. Scikit is easier than for example caret in R. And Keras makes DL easy too. 

However, for any general data analysis and manipulation Python feels way harder. Before even doing a linear regression I have to know wtf a “class” object is and how it works. I don’t think in terms of classes and OOP at all. I think more mathematically. (I did get used to this part of Python now but it took longer and I am still not good with making my own class) 

Compare that to R where literally on day 1 of using it I can figure out how to use lm() and glm(). I don’t need to know any OOP. 

Then pandas is another hellhole. The whole .loc and .iloc differences and indexing becomes annoying. Can’t figure out how to nest the dataframe easily by a group so that I can resample within a group for every group type thing and when I look it up I get a bunch of solutions pointing to using dictionary and iterators etc. In R I could use group_by() with nest() and then use map() or lapply(). 

Oh also and then if you do a=b in python it doesn’t create a copy but its some pointer. In R I can do this without worry with no idea what a pointer even is. While Python there is some no.copy() or copy.deepcopy() you have to use. 

Without CS knowledge R is FAR FAR easier. I can literally get right into the analysis without learning all this overhead about data structures and class objects. Data manipulation is so easy with dplyr and purrr and the % &amp;gt; %

Then to get interactions and everything within a design matrix in Python I have to use patsy so that I can do the R-like formula syntax. 

Maybe for unstructured data like images/NLP and deep learning Python might be better but all the data I deal with is tabular. For unstructured data you need some CS knowledge anyways.

,datascience,"I’ve been in data analysis in a biomedical research lab for 3 years since i graduated in my undergrad.(in kinesiology and dietetics) I mostly do data cleaning but i also I helped design UX and UI for 3 iOS apps and Im the project manager/study coordinator.

But for the past year I’ve been learning full stack web development with django/ Django Rest Framework/ JavaScript, data science with anaconda, iOS swift development, and small raspberry pi projects. I recently finished an IBM data science course on coursera where I published a Django blog where i just had one post about machine learning. I analyzed my local restaurants based on how common and popular they were with the foursquare api. Then i graphed the geospatial data with folium on a Chloropleth map based on housing prices i got from Zillow. I’ve seen whole medium blog posts/ reddit posts about how these blogs are worthless since they’re just linear regression which is a bit disheartening. But I’m pretty proud of it coming from a life sciences background with minimal math.

I think I have the experience and the knowledge to move on to a entry level data engineer position or data science. At the very least a higher paying data analysis role with less management. I had to manage study recruitment, advertising, contacting participants, setting up appointments, IRB submissions, training creation, and the actual training most recently due to a lack of proper budgeting.

&lt;p&gt;But for the past year I’ve been learning full stack web development with django/ Django Rest Framework/ JavaScript, data science with anaconda, iOS swift development, and small raspberry pi projects. I recently finished an IBM data science course on coursera where I published a Django blog where i just had one post about machine learning. I analyzed my local restaurants based on how common and popular they were with the foursquare api. Then i graphed the geospatial data with folium on a Chloropleth map based on housing prices i got from Zillow. I’ve seen whole medium blog posts/ reddit posts about how these blogs are worthless since they’re just linear regression which is a bit disheartening. But I’m pretty proud of it coming from a life sciences background with minimal math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I have the experience and the knowledge to move on to a entry level data engineer position or data science. At the very least a higher paying data analysis role with less management.

,datascience,"Hello everyone, I am a long-time lurker of the sub and just wanted to ask a question that has been on my mind for some time now. (TLDR at bottom)

&amp;#x200B;

Is going into a data science diploma program from a bootcamp like Brainstation the right decision?

&amp;#x200B;

My background is in business; I finished my **B. Comm in Supply Chain Management** this year and got interested in data science as my program had built-in 2 courses on data science. Learnt a lot about data mining, science, stuff like Bayes Theorem, kNN, etc despite not getting too much coding experience in it as we used analytics software. However, the whole concept of actually using the potential of big data to derive insights for companies, and optimize their operations got me really interested in a career in business-oriented data scientist. Also have a background in stats through my program.

&amp;#x200B;

My work experiences include my internship at a **Fortune500** healthcare supplies company, where I was tasked on doing data analysis on inventory and sales. At this point, I understood that Advanced Excel can only take you so far in data analytics. My other work-related experience was my capstone project with **Walmart Inc**. This involved performing a **data mining project** in regards to their eCommerce fulfillment (can't disclose much more due to NDA).

I really want to hone in on data science, and plan on using it in-tandem with my business knowledge to help firms learn and optimize their business processes. I have been searching through the sub, YouTube, Quoram and whatever source and experience I can find on the viability of a boot camp as a legitimate way to get into the field. I found that a good amount of people are **advising against data science boot camps** (and boot camps in general) as companies and Hiring Managers always prioritize candidates who have a degree in mathematics or CS, rather than a boot camp.

Would someone like me, who is really interested in a data science career and coming from a business background realistically be able to start a DS career from a boot camp?

Is the viability of  bootcamps really that bad? Or is this simply the case of comparing career prospects of students who have only done a degree in CS, engineering, math, etc. vs. someone who doesn't have a degree and only did a bootcamp? This was an impression I got from some of the articles and videos that I read up on. I totally understand a degree is more comprehensive, but will it fit my background as I already have a degree (albeit not in CS/eng/math) or will I need to get a degree in STEM as well?

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, most of the master programs for the current year have already filled, and I will have to wait another year atleast to get enrolled into one of the masters program. I don't want to wait that long, and rather start a boot camp soon and get working experience as a DS sooner rather than being later. Waiting it out would put my career in an awkward position :/

&amp;#x200B;

This has been bothering me for a while, and I thank you for hearing me out :)Any advice or experience from you guys will be really valuable, and will help me out a ton.

**TLDR**: finished my B.comm in supply chain. Have some informal work xp as a data scientist. Want to be business-oriented data scientist.

,datascience,"Hi all,

Semi long text incoming but I'm feeling pretty lost and could really use some guidance/insight.

I'm currently 32, been working as a Tableau and Alteryx consultant for about 6 months after a job history in IT (last job was consultant/Windows SysAdmin for hire)

I'm fascinated by ML and I've been trying to get into the field but I'm not seeing a path forward. 

I've got no PhD, masters or bs (only something called a Propedeuse which means that you've completed all of the 1 years courses) and I thought I would/could make it with a decent portfolio and GitHub. As a first step
I landed this job after a Business Analytics program that took 6 months and covered BA, some light statistics and DS but nothing major.
I've got a decent skillset in Python and SQL due to my history in IT.

I've set myself challenges to complete some DS projects like the the Titanic set and house pricing set from Kaggle and I'm currently working through O'Reilly's Hands-On ML but I'm getting the feeling that I'm putting a lot of time and effort into something without being efficient or without it ever culminating into something. I love working on the projects, understanding the methods and completing them but I'm not looking for a hobby; I'm looking for a career path.

Most job listings are really looking for a degree and starting that track at my age, with a full time job and 2 small children is going to be challenging and really time consuming (at least 4 years to complete a bachelor's degree). 

But with all of this, I just need to know; what path should I follow? Keep plugging at Kaggle, get back to school or just...take my leave and find peace with hobbying?

edit : Thanks for all the responses everyone, this got way bigger then I expected it to be!
I think it boils down to the fact that ""homeschooling"" isn't going to get me further and/or faster then every other freshly graduated student with a bs or ms or phd.

For now I think that the best course would be to focus on my Alteryx and Tableau work (mainly Alteryx b/c to be honest, the design aspect of Tableau just isn't my cup of tea), save up for the tuition fees and start working on a degree when I'm established at work and not caring for a baby anymore. The degree, and what it stands for, might just be the only realistic way of getting on the same level.

The degree, and what it stands for, might just be the only realistic way of getting on the same level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for all of your comments!&lt;/p&gt;

,datascience,"Hello

I would love to get some input regarding some concerns I have about entering the data science field. Currently, I am looking at enrolling on a MSc in Data Science. The course looks very interesting. Here are some of the modules covered for those of you that may be interested;

\- Machine Learning

\- Big Data

\- Neural Computing

\- Visual Analytics 

with electives in Cloud and Deep learning.

The university that offers this programme is known for its preference towards applied learning and implementation in industry, and less of a focus on the mathematical/statistical side of data science. 

Anyway, I have been doing a lot of research for the kinds of roles this course would prepare me for, as well as trying to get a grasp from current data scientists about what they do on a daily basis in their roles. Many people say that unless you have a strong understanding of mathematics, you wont progress in data science. How true is this? I ask because I have a much greater interest in applying tools to manipulate data to tell a story, or advise a company what course of action to take based on what the data is telling me, rather than creating complex algorithms and models to solve a complex issue. Is there a feasible role for me in the field where I can achieve this? I have a feeling this may be more of a data analyst role, but correct me if I am wrong.

,datascience,"Hello,

So currently I am working as a data scientist and started studying again on top.
Apparently, I have total chaos at home now regarding hardware.

Company guidelines allow me to do testing and prototyping on private hardware (which I do, as I have it available and it is way faster than asking IT for Ressources every time).

Currently I have a small Xeon server running Ubuntu with docker and a jupyter server, a private workstation laptop (heavy and clumsy), an powerful windows desktop, a Mac mini by my company, a laptop by my company, and an private iPad Pro („laptop replacement“).

The result is total chaos. Data of my private projects gets cluttered everywhere, I sometimes hook up laptops to docking stations even if I would need the power of the desktop as I don’t want to waste time setting up virtual Python environments over and over again, and so on.

And I feel like it’s becoming more and more of a problem as my work and studying evolves. Sometimes I just need to setup an entire new Hadoop or Spark System for testing or a few databases or whatever.

So I am thinking about what to do. I thought about upgrading my server and only rely on the server and a thin and light „dumb terminal“-Laptop. But it would be a lot of work managing, maybe expensive, and impair my work on the go as I have to work in environments where it is often simply not possible to connect to my home VPN.

The point is basically that I overall don’t need much for the most time. Python, maybe a jupyter Notebook, and that’s it. But I often stumble on points where I just suddenly need a GPU for CUDA or a few databases or a few virtual machines. And evertime one of those needs comes up I have to move my entire work up until that point from the more mobile but weak to the more static but powerful hardware (iPad -&gt; Laptop -&gt; Desktop &lt;-&gt; Server).

Another alternative I was thinking about getting an thin and light Laptop with not much power and and an mediocre desktop at home that’s just there to have a lot of storage and connect to multiple displays. I could then maybe run every project (like a single node Spark System or Django development) in an public cloud environment like on an AWS machine. This would skip the migration step from one of my hardware pieces to another and save me a lot of time and headache.
But this implys a long term problem. It would be expensive to pay the upkeep of every single instance that’s not needed at the moment. So I would need a way to archive an entire cloud machine locally in case I need the work maybe months later again.
I have no idea if AWS or anything provided this ability or if this idea makes financially any sense at all.

So how do you handle the hardware demands for your data science (especially data engineering) needs? Where do you prototype and test for maybe personal projects and how do you treat your work to not loose anything in the long run and can reuse it?
Any experiences with the ideas I had?

Every input, suggestion or idea highly appreciated.

Hey all!

First off, I cannot believe the amount of positive feedback and sign-ups I received on my previous post. I’m honestly floored! In order to accommodate all of the sign-ups, we’re going to host three separate sessions so (almost) everyone is able to attend. Now, if you’ve already signed up, you should have received an email asking you to pick one of these sessions. FYI, it’s first come first serve.

For those who weren’t able to sign up but are still interested, there are a couple options!

1. We are going to do this monthly so you can definitely attend the next session. Use [this sign up sheet](https://forms.gle/RqZ5Hp2QmgLzoowD8) so I know to include you in the next session.
2. We are going to record a session and share it.

Also, I know I won’t be able to get to all of the questions you submitted so I’m going to work on other ways to answer all of the questions you asked. If you have any ideas, I'm all ears!

Thanks again,

Madhav

I started as a Data Science Researcher at a company that had no real connected data infrastructure, then I basically volunteered to build it all and design the analytics. They made me Business Intelligence Developer reasoning that I'm more technical than an analyst but I'm not doing any data science - just building pipelines, dashboards, and recommending improvements to data architecture (there is no data architect).

At this point, I'm definitely a junior data scientist at best - I know a lot of theory but don't have a ton of experience applying concepts, and much of my work involves reporting on historical data. I have a lot of subject knowledge around social media, political science, economics, law, psychometrics, and behavioral psych - I might be considered a polymath - but my work barely scratches the surface. I'm really good at using R for packages and shiny dashboards, but not so great with python or the more advanced SQL queries. I don't even have a public git repo where I show off my code to potential recruiters. I do get paid $80+ which is nice.

My team is somewhat central to the organization's data. I'm in charge of creating requirements for most of our product data, recommending changes to product support, creating company-wide surveys, and have access to HR data. For a while, I was the go-to problem solver and de-facto team lead until a manager was hired over me - now I just seem to get tasked with dev work. Now that the data infrastructure is more or less coming together, my manager wants to use a cloud ready-tools like AWS Glue and Quicksight over establishing a real DS toolset.

I'd love to hear some advice on how to optimize my career from here. Choices seem to be to

* **Stick it out**. The challenge here is that my manager is a real barrier to job satisfaction and advancement. I have very little autonomy, and all of my strategic input is shot down via manager telephone (e.g. ""I asked and the VPs said they don't want to do that"" or ""I asked our boss and they say to not have conversations with the other team to gather requirements for your proposal to fix their data model"").
* **Move on.** The challenge here is that my work experience makes me not a perfect fit for a lot of data science jobs. there aren't many jobs that I am both qualified for, and are broad enough to let me flex. I don't have and advance degree, I'm missing some languages, no clearance, no practical AI/ML/NLP/Regression experience. I've sent out several applications with no nibbles.

,datascience,"Hello,

I've been attempting to use BO to optimize a black box function, and started by using [https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization) 

I then switched to try to use the newer Facebook Ax library, thinking it would improve results. Unfortunately, it hasn't. In the BO python package above, there is a concept of ""Domain Reduction"", which when used with my black box function has been very successful in rapidly finding near optimal ranges for 26 parameters, some Choice and some Int/Float Range. I've linked it here:

[https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization/blob/master/bayes\_opt/domain\_reduction.py](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization/blob/master/bayes_opt/domain_reduction.py)  
[https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization/blob/master/examples/domain\_reduction.ipynb](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization/blob/master/examples/domain_reduction.ipynb)

I've tried running Ax on the same data, configured in a similar fashion without the ""Domain Reduction"" extra above, and gotten significantly worse results. My attempts were run with: Sobol 30 steps, 150 GPEI trials, as well as 250 trials. It never came close to optimizing the target.

I've been struggling to understand two things:

1. Is this somewhat already implemented (bounds tightening, domain reduction, in any sense) in the Ax project?
2. If not, what would be my best path to adding something like this within Ax?
3. Are there any better tools for my task?

,datascience,"I am a recent computer science graduate (I earned a master's degree). I have an undergrad in information systems. I went through college math classes like calculus, multi-variable calculus, statistics, discrete mathematics and linear algebra.

As soon as I entered the master's program in computer science, I always felt that I was missing some math in comparison to people who have had a computer science undergrad. That thought haunted me. Because of that thought, I was reviewing math during my master's and took hard math courses other computer science students didn't want to enroll in because they heard they were hard. I passed those classes, even though sometimes it was brutally hard to balance that class alongside my difference exams (which I had since I came from information systems undergrad). In short, my past 2 years of computer science master's were brutally hard, but I had the chip on my shoulder from coming from an information systems undergrad and worked extra hard to pass classes (and sometimes more than just pass).

**In the past few weeks, I had this idea that I should review math from the ground-up (start off with all the Khan Academy videos, then move towards textbooks) because I most likely have gaps in my math knowledge.** Even though I know that most computer science master's degree holders have some gaps in their math knowledge (as does anyone), this thought won't leave me.

**I want to be a data scientist or a machine learning engineer - but the positions I'm after are not some research positions where I'd be developing a new algorithm.** The positions I'm after are simpler - applying BERT to new languages, for example. After I get the hang of the job, I thought of doing freelance consulting work. If during my job I encounter some material I need to brush up on (whether it's math or something else) I can review it on the fly. Even if I have to read some paper on my job, usually the formulas there are already derived and if I don't understand them, I can ask someone on my job or I can ask people on this subreddit or something similar.

,datascience,"Hello all,

Received an offer from Deloitte within the last few days and wanted to touch base with other technical folks in the same realm.

**The offer seems quite a bit low:** $105k base, + 15% AIP; coming in at the consultant level.

**Quick facts:** About 2 YOE in data science (machine/deep learning), based on the west coast. MS degree.

Is this offer on par with what other software engineers and data scientists are getting within the consulting space?

I can't imagine they can recruit technical folks with this kind of offer, considering what pure tech companies are willing to pay.

Looking for any and all guidance here.

Thanks!

P.S. Really don't mean to discount the value of consulting careers and the experience you'd gain. there's far more to life than T.C. -- just looking to understand if I'm getting lowballed and if this is consistent with what others are seeing.

,datascience,"Hey guys, I have written my first blog post on how to plot decision boundaries for classification models. Plotting decision boundaries can help immensely in the model selection and hyperparameter tuning process, as it can help detect overfitting or underfitting. [Here](https://vivianrjkmr.github.io/2020/09/01/decision-boundary-visualization) is the link.

**The motivation for my post**

I noticed that many online explanations and tutorials explaining overfitting rely on 2D datasets (i.e. datasets with only two input features). Such boundaries can be easily plotted on a 2D plane, but what if your data contains six input features? One can use dimensionality reduction to plot the actual points, but what about the decision boundaries themselves? This is what my post explores.

It would be an amazing help if you could spare some time to take a look, and maybe give me some feedback. If you liked it, feel free to ""like"" my post.

,datascience,"I was browsing Kaggle datasets and looking at the work done by the community. It was a bit disappointing to see that a large majority of the work done is plain wrong because people don't read the problem statement and apply common sense.

For instance, here is an interesting [dataset on heart failure](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data). You would expect people to read and understand the problem. The problem involves 2 target features - time and death\_event. The time column tells us how many days it took for death, and the death\_event tells if the person died or not. 

If you are building a model, you should not use the time column, since that is clearly not available to us during prediction on unseen data!

Alas, there are a 100+ submissions of notebooks, all touting 0.93+ AUC based on xgboost. Each one of them have a data leak because they used the time feature. Each one of them proudly display the variable importance graph and show time as the most important variable. No shit, Sherlock!

Let’s put aside any discussions about the accuracy of these models and the scale of the impact on society and for the purposes of this post agree that there will, at the very least, be effects, and that these effects are growing with time.

Now, management asks you the regular questions: forecast sales for next year, recommend how much product to keep in stock, propose where to establish stores, predict supply line delays, etc. In a “normal world”, we would assume business as usual and not bother about freak tropical storms impacting our East Asian manufacturing, pandemics decimating demand, or blizzards disrupting our supply lines.

By leaving out the effects of climate change, we, the forecasters, are effectively predicting that the cost to our business of doing nothing is zero. Thus, our lobbying departments will lobby against any reform that would negatively impact our results under past conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have a process or methodology - do you write code in Python to ouput &amp;quot;Random Forest - X, Boosted Tree - Y, etc&amp;quot;. Would there be a way to automatically run a few models and print their associated graphs, scores etc?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

,datascience,"Hello! I'm trying to build a predictive model for work. The model should predict the number of orders that'll be delayed. The data is from a production site. Delay means if the time taken to produce an order takes more than target cycle time. And there are hundreds of order in a day with different target ct and elapsed time. Now, these are the two fields I have in database, target ct and elapsed time. 
But the way I'm predicting till now is from a data that comes from a dashboard (Qlik). Qlik expression (If Elapsed time/Target CT &gt;1 then lagging flag =1, order is delayed) calculates if an order is delayed and then sum all the orders for the day. So, from qlik data, I have two columns, Date and number of delayed orders for that day. I have only tried building Arima models from the qlik data and forecasting is not accurate at all. I'm using JMP btw, since qlik data wasn't that huge.

Dear Data Scientists / Analysts, (I really need help)

I am an graduate of BBA Finance / BBA Marketing with a very low GPA of 2.38 due to a personal matter and due to having a full time job of 12 hours during my studies, which should not be an excuse.

I am looking to study in Canada, mainly to get a PGWP to be honest, but as a Business field student, I've been interested in MBA but It's expensive, and I was told to avoid it as employers tend to pay for it, and it would cost more than Data Science &amp; Analytics

I am trying to find a good university/college that has a graduate full-time Diploma with a duration of  
1 to 2 years for Data Science &amp; Analytics in Canada, mainly in Alberta or British Columbia or any affordable rent province/city that has a good quality of life as I've heard that Canada is a province country and it's better to study at the place you want to live in, I really want Alberta but unfortunately only University of Calgary provides such degree and they do not accept anyone under 2.5 GPA under any circumstances &lt;/3

,datascience,"Hi community!

I've been asking many questions, and I do want to express my gratitude! However, I came across a thought. Is the ""Normal Distribution"" curve a universal thing or is it specific to the data you are looking at?

For example, let's take digital advertising. We have 1000s of different ads running. However, most would generate a click of 0 during their run. This would cause the distribution graph to look abnormal because of the amount of zeros there are. However, this is normal to us because it's something we've seen for years (at least at this company). So, because this has been observed so many times, would this be a ""Normal Distribution"" ?

If my question is dumb, I apologize.

,datascience,"I am a product manager with a strong background in software development (not as much in data science / statistics) working with several startups. Each of these companies, one in the marketing competitive intelligence space and the other in the supplier performance management space, features a proprietary scoring model. I'd like to learn more about developing scoring models, yet I feel it's an interdisciplinary challenge so I'm not even sure if this is the right sub to ask this question.

One of the scores primarily involves quantifying Likert scale survey responses then scaling a weighted average of the results to a 0-100 score in which 50 is the midpoint. We've faced challenges describing this score to clients because the school grading scale is ingrained in their minds, so they'll interpret a 65 as a D, which is bad, but on our scale it's actually somewhat positive.

As I work on developing the next iteration of this score, I'd like to change the scale, but I want to use sound reasoning rather than making an arbitrary decision. Are there best practices in any discipline where I could learn more about this? What are some keywords I could search to find relevant journal articles? I've found tons of literature addressing specific aspects of scoring, such as assessing its validity and reliability, but nothing that integrates all the relevant parts.

How do organizations develop scoring models that support meaningful interpretation of results? One example I've thought a lot about is the credit scoring model from 300-850. Why was this scale chosen? Why not 30-85? Why not 3000-8500 or 100-500? Is there any scientific reasoning behind this or is it really just arbitrarily choosing a methodology then marketing the scale until people learn it? Other examples I've thought about are standardized testing (ACT up to 36, SAT up to 2400), various D&amp;B scales (some 1-5, some 0-100), NFL passer rating (0-158), and even non-numeric scales like S&amp;P credit rating.

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to any feedback or resources. If anyone has recommendations for an alternate sub where I could x-post this, I&amp;#39;d also be appreciative. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

,datascience,"Hi r/datascience, 

I was recently laid off from my job as a Data Analyst at a well known California based non-profit due to COVID related budget cuts.  Since then, I've basically been auto-rejected from every job I've applied to and am not sure what I'm doing wrong.  

I'm under no illusions of applying to a Data Scientist position but am applying to more junior Data Analyst roles given my background and experience. 

For reference, I have 2.5 years experience managing and querying databases, manipulating that data for either reports, dashboards, and ML models, and providing 'data support' to business or scientists.

My academic background is a little different than most analysts given I have a BA and MA in History but I taught myself SQL, Python, Alteryx, and Tableau and have applied those to real world situations at work. I also spin the History degree as providing me with excellent story telling skills which is a key component of the data analysis process. This has worked for me in the past. 

Prior to that I had five years tech-support experience and 1 year database management experience at smaller companies. 

I am proficient at SQL queries, Tableau, manipulating data in either drag and drop tools (Alteryx), general Python including Pandas, Numpy, and enough Scikit-learn to run the built in models but not make my own at this point. 

I'm also working on some side projects for my portfolio including an A-Z data analysis where I scrape websites using BeautifulSoup, clean the data, run some basic stats with visuals in Numpy and Matplotlib, apply the data to a multi-linear regression model, and then create a dashboard in Tableau for additional descriptive exploration. 

I am looking at jobs around the San Francisco Bay area since I'm relatively close, it seems like that's where the jobs are, and my girlfriend can find work there as well. 

I feel like I'm doing everything right but just can't get an interview.  Is it the History degree that's holding me back or just the analytics field in general right now?

,datascience,"Hi there data scientist. Today I come to you seeking for advice as I came to a cross road in my life. My dream is to eventually get a position as a researcher in Artificial General Intelligence. As I understand it is a highly competitive position, one which a PhD does not necessarily guarantee a researcher position.

To help create a more appealing CV, my plan was to get a job in Data Science next year after obtaining my Honors in computer science. My manager and I have a good relationship, so I told him about my plans, and he was more than willing to put me into touch with Data Science managers to understand what they look for in a data scientist. He also told me that most positions are frozen due to the craziness going on in the world as well as that I might have to sacrifice some of my income (which I am willing to do). He also told me that we have a big data position open in our team in which I would work closely with data scientists in productionizing their ml models and help setup, maintain and optimize the distributed environment for data scientists.   


His requirement is that I stay in this position for at least 3 years which is conflicts my timeline in the sense that I would like to finish masters in two years time and then apply for PhD abroad. My guess is that the experience in the big data position would be less valued (don't know by how much) than a data science position. The upside is that I keep my income (maybe even strengthen it with this position), I don't have to take the risk of possibly not getting a job in data science and the position still aligns with my end goal.   


What do you think? Is it worth taking the risk and try landing a data science position next year or should I rather play it safe and take the position he offered and sacrifice an extra year. Please share the reason to your choice as well as this is more important to me.

,datascience,"Quick background: I graduated with my MS in data science in January 2019. I decided to pursue a PhD because I noticed that all the jobs I wanted either required or strongly encouraged a PhD. I'm 1.5 years into a PhD in computer science, which includes statistics and natural language processing. My masters thesis was in time series. Before that, I was working as an analyst without programming skills. During my masters, I did two data analyst/data science internships.


I've been trying to find a remote, part-time internship for a while now to keep my industry skills sharp and never even got to the interview stage since starting my PhD. I figured with my experience, I was perfect for an internship: I have academic experience, I have a little bit of industry experience, but I really need mentorship and guidance when dealing with practical problems.


Last week, one company emailed me back but told me that they were offering the paid internship that I'd applied to as unpaid only, and they asked me if I was interested in an interview. I figured why not, at the least it would be good interview practice. 


Horrific is maybe an exaggeration, but it was truly awful. So first of all, the company deals with image classification, which I've never done outside of classes. Maybe I was naive, but I thought that a few classes I took two years ago and my more recent experience in natural language processing might be enough to translate into an internship in image classification. I was wrong. 


I didn't realize it was going to be a technical interview. They immediately started off by asking me if I knew a certain term and to explain it. I had never even heard of it, so I'm not sure if it was a library, a concept, or a software (yes, I should have written it down but at this point, I was very flustered). This continued for maybe ten different terms. With each one, I'd never heard of it. I wish I had just cut the interview short after the first two or three since it was such an obvious mismatch. They eventually gave up and just asked me to explain what I was currently working on, and the interview ended.


I don't know where to go from here. Clearly there is a huge discrepancy between my skills and the skills that this company was expecting from someone with an undergrad or masters degree in data science/machine learning. Normally, I would find a bootcamp or some course and start up from scratch again. But I'm wondering if it would be better to focus on what I'm doing in my PhD and try to hone one or two skills. I am scared of either (a) pigeon-holing myself and not being able to find a job in those specific areas or (b) broadening my skills to the point that I don't actually know anything important about a wide variety of data science concepts.

They eventually gave up and just asked me to explain what I was currently working on, and the interview ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know where to go from here. Clearly there is a huge discrepancy between my skills and the skills that this company was expecting from someone with an undergrad or masters degree in data science/machine learning. Normally, I would find a bootcamp or some course and start up from scratch again. But I&amp;#39;m wondering if it would be better to focus on what I&amp;#39;m doing in my PhD and try to hone one or two skills. I am scared of either (a) pigeon-holing myself and not being able to find a job in those specific areas or (b) broadening my skills to the point that I don&amp;#39;t actually know anything important about a wide variety of data science concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By getting a PhD, did I ruin my chances of working in anything other than what I&amp;#39;m working on now? Should I focus on building up my natural language processing skills or should I start spending my evenings doing more general coursework that would be applicable to other data science areas?&lt;/p&gt;

,datascience,"Hi Reddit,

Finally, I've become a grown-up and recently just graduated from my university.

I come from an MSc in business intelligence and have about one year of experience with study jobs, that is mostly focused on ""front-end business intelligence"". Basically,  that means making dashboarding and working with already ready data.

So, now I just hit an interview with Amazon and I'm pretty impressed that they wanna interview with me even though I lack experience, and therefore I'm here to ask for help.

As you can see in the [Job Posting](https://amazon.jobs/en-gb/jobs/1236454/business-intelligence-analyst-6-month-contract) I pretty much need two years experience and be proficient in SQL. Well, to anyone's information I'm quite confident in everything than SQL. I know for sure, that this job requires a lot of technical skills within data extraction, manipulation etc for business requirements.

And.. I'm pretty sucky in SQL having only had in school and made some basic query. The interview is on Wednesday, and I don't know if I should just try it? They send an e-mail, that said they will have live coding test on me but I basically am scared because I'm terrible at this part.

What's ur suggestion? I have two days to maybe run a data camp for fundamentals of SQL, but I'm unsure if that's enough to consider myself worthy for this position?

,datascience,"Hi everyone, I have a question and it'd be awesome if you guys tell me what you know/think about it.

So, I'm a business graduate and I want to specialize in DS by getting into a master degree program. However, as expected, I'm not an expert on mathematics, statistics or coding (Even though, I've taken some courses on these areas, I consider myself pretty weak) 

During my studies I've got the chance to learn and work with SQL and Spss and since then, I'm thinking to do my master degree on DS.  

Recently, I've found a fairly new master programme and judging by their curriculum, it looks very promising but also, tough. Professors are expert on their department, they are working mainly with R and Python, university provides free Datacamp courses, plus students are expected to apply their skills on cloud platforms such as: Github, Tableau, Kaggle etc.

I'm looking up the post about entering data science and  mostly people who post them are either mathematicians, statistics/computer science (or other related) majors. So they have some type of prior knowledge on these and I assume it might be easier for them. But, I'm not expert in any of those areas and I don't know to what extend I should know these. (I'm bad at coding and math btw) They say that, statistics, algebra, coding, calculus, etc. is a must, when it comes to data science. However, basic coding and math skills along with learning R, Spss and Python to some degree seems enough for the most part. (At least what I understand) 

So, I don't know to what extent I should know these fields and that's what scares me. I mean, I love working with data and analyse/interpret it but, I don't know how much of my time will I spend on learning these type of concepts etc.(To what degree one should know them? Like, if I have to get into D.S. do I have to speed my time mostly on these? Or just the basics?) Thus, I can not decide if I can manage even finishing the degree or not.

,datascience,"I have been learning python for about a year now. I just downloaded R to try using Python with [Reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/).

I most definitely have pandas pip installed in this base environment along with the other two packages. Just to be sure, I double checked by running a ```pip install``` for all 3 again.

,datascience,"My background: I have a PhD in Physics, which was heavy on the data analysis &amp; Monte Carlo simulations (but in a non-OOP language few have heard of). And I've spent the last 8 years working in finance at a top-tier bank in data engineer / financial analyst combinational role.

During lockdown I've completed [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/) (highly recommended for beginners) and I've now started planning for the future. With a mix of the professional and personal I'm considering (covid notwithstanding) taking a sabbatical next spring to travel and study.

Initially I thought a Master's in Data Science was the best option and had settled on applying for the [MSDS at Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/master-of-applied-data-science-umich). However this would cost $42k and with my current background I think a master's might be overkill anyway. So I'm currently considering taking a year out and aiming to finish all/most of the below in lieu of a masters:

* Two 'MicroMasters' one at [MIT](https://www.edx.org/course/probability-the-science-of-uncertainty-and-data) (heavy on the Statistics) and [UCSanDiego](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/uc-san-diegox-data-science) (heavy on Python, ML &amp; Spark) - to be clear, I'll do both - approx 1,100 hours of study and $2,750 in total.
* Several Coursera certificates: - 500 hours in total
   * [Michigan Applied DS](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) \- general overview ML, data mining.
   * [IBM Applied DS](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) \- covers ML with a Capstone project
   * [IBM AI Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer) \- ML, Apache Spark, Keras, PyTorch, TensorFlow with a Capstone project.
   * Three different courses from deeplearning.ai, which seem to extensively cover [Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?), [TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice?) and [Natural Language](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing#courses) processing.
* There's also a broad Specialization from [HSE](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml) on coursera, but at 240 hrs this looks similar to MicroMasters.
* Finally, I'll probably finish the R module on Dataquest \~30 hours

The above will likely evolve as I learn more. And I'll keep an eye out for worthwhile Kaggle projects (already finished the Titanic project).

Long-term I may wish to move away from finance entirely, maybe even back to academia. But short-term I might be best placed to attempt to pivot back to finance into a full time data science role for a few years and then decide from there.

I'd really appreciate any advice or suggestions on anything, but especially; 1. the merits of foregoing a masters over the above. 2. comments on the future plans, 3. Kaggle suggestions, 4.

Hello, I am a sophomore in college. My school recently started a data science program. It is only offered as a double major. I am interested in analytics, finance and tech so I was going to major in Econ/ data science (this new program)

My concern after browsing this subreddit is that competition for new grads seems to be fierce, and many of you seem to encourage going for a CS degree in case it doesn’t work out. I am interested in working with data and analytics but I don’t want to become a SWE, so I’d like to avoid a major that’s so specialized in that regard. 

I go to a decent school (USC) so I feel fairly confident in my ability to network around LA.

My school recently started a data science program. It is only offered as a double major. I am interested in analytics, finance and tech so I was going to major in Econ/ data science (this new program)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My concern after browsing this subreddit is that competition for new grads seems to be fierce, and many of you seem to encourage going for a CS degree in case it doesn’t work out. I am interested in working with data and analytics but I don’t want to become a SWE, so I’d like to avoid a major that’s so specialized in that regard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go to a decent school (USC) so I feel fairly confident in my ability to network around LA.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm currenly trying to use the orange data mining tool via both supervised and unsupervised learning - to study past historical sales trend and product images, and project future trends using more images.

However, i'm having difficulties integrating images into the workflow because of the type of data image embedding returns (999 numerical values etc.) - anyone can point me in the right direction on how to make this work?

,datascience,"Data scientist?  What does that mean?  What is its value?  I know many struggle with this question.  Let me try to provide some clarity and thoughts by comparing to other professions.  

In this world there are many big industries: oil, energy, auto, pharmaceutical, aero, shipping, finance, etc.   just to name a few.   There are other newer businesses also usually built on marketing plans like FB.   Each specific company has different data infrastructure, business needs, and problems to solve.    Each company has to make profits.  If they are collecting or trying to collect data then they want to use it to optimize/estimate/predict and make more profits.  Data scientists build capability or products to do this.  ""Data Engineers"" do assist in the infrastructure but without the people that analyze data/extract value, data engineering wouldnt be needed.

Now we can ask the questions of who is qualified for this work and how much is a data scientist job title worth?  And is everyone now a data scientist?
Well what is a financial analyst worth,  what is an engineer worth?   Who can do those jobs? Is everyone an engineer?  It all depends on the business.    For these other professions they usually require accredited schools and some require standard certifications like PE license. At the same time, some technicians in companies end up with ""engineer"" title through experience with no accreditation.  So the qualifications depend on the job and business.  Also,  just because one is experienced in one business doesn’t mean they make a large amount of money, because their industry may be in a bad time in history.   Many professional engineers in oil industry are cut or making less today.   In finance I am sure big bankers make a whole lot more than little ones and are basically a different profession than little banks due to skill set.  But both are considered financial analysts.  One thing the other professions have learned is their industry domain expertise, with traditional skills.  Which usually analyzes data already in their jobs.  ""Data"" itself is not an industry, at least in my opinion.

Data science is even more general than these other professions.  I could find a high school student and train them to be a data scientist very cheaply and quickly on some dataset using powerBi, with little math skills.  But they won’t know much about other domains, business, profits, design, coding, and consequences of data decisions.  Most importantly they won’t have domain or business knowledge.  Which they will need in order to get a good data science job and provide value to business. They could probably find one with some small organization trying to analyze their data like at a local library or city govt.  But it won’t pay well, maybe even minimum wage.  This would be just a few steps under the large amount of people today getting a BS or just a MS without a thesis.  So the low end will be getting flooded with this type of job seeker.  This is ok since everyone with data wants to profit from it.  But due to lack of accreditation or licenses and supply/demand these jobs will be low pay, unlike engineering. 

Now many wonder how do I just get the highest paid job with the smallest amount of education in data science?  This question appears here almost multiple times a day.   The answer is hard,  one can do it with just a no thesis MS but it may not pay well.  It is a continuum, where depending on what you know, and who you know you will be qualified for various roles.  If you have a phd, highly technical, understand business problems, and have personal connections you can work at Google.  If not then it will be more difficult.  Having a traditional degree/experience like engineering or finance helps with these skills.  

Data science won’t go away but expand vastly.  Its skills include math, stats, engineering, and business skills depending on the person. It will not be taken over by analysts and software engineering but the opposite will happen in prototyping phases.  The pay and people in the field would also expand, making many lower and higher paid jobs available with vastly different skills.   It will not be a clear distribution of pay, but multi-modal,  and average pay will not mean anything due to many modes of pay.  

So in take away, if you want the best and highest paid job as a “data scientist”,  You need higher education, correct technical skills for a profitable company, understand a company/industry, and know people.   There is no easy route and as always the only path to greatness is putting in the work for years, getting out,  and networking.   And even after getting all that education, you can still end up not being valuable.

* [Github](https://github.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceForest)
* [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/miceForest/)

I'm a huge fan of documentation, so I've included a very comprehensive README on the github, which explains the MICE algorithm and the details of the package.

# What is MICE?

Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) is an iterative method that allows you to fill in missing data using all of the available information in the dataset. Over a series of iterations, every column in the data set gets modeled by the other columns, and the missing values are inferred by the model. Stef Van Buuren wrote the book on missing data, which details the algorithm [here](https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/ch-introduction.html).

Random forests are a good 'chaining equation' to use because they:

1. Do not need much hyperparameter tuning
2. Easily handle non-linear relationships in the data
3. Can return OOB performance inexpensively
4. Are trivially parallelizable
5. Can return feature importance for diagnostics

# What is it used for?

I do a lot of funnel modeling at my current position, and MICE has proven invaluable. It allows us to eliminate bias in the funnel caused by missing data being 'less missing' the further up the funnel you go, which allows us to:

1. Use all available information, no matter the funnel stage
2. Create confidence intervals on our predictions. More data filled out = less imputed variance = a more confident prediction. This allows us to create more robust confidence intervals for our forecasts.

# Motivation?

I originally developed this package for R because all of the available packages were lacking in either speed or features. As I start using Python more, I noticed that the available MICE implementations do not provide the functionality I find myself using most often (custom imputation schemas, built in diagnostic plotting, imputing new data).",t2_i8ujh,False,,0,False,New Library - Multiple Imputation by Random Forests in Python,[],r/datascience,False,6,projects,0,,,False,t3_iehsf2,False,dark,0.98,,public,177,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Projects,False,177,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1598129100.0,text,6,,,text,self.datascience,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi &lt;a href=""/r/datascience""&gt;r/datascience&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

My current feature space is roughly 4,500 attributes. I'm using LightGBM + Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning.

Since the last few months, I have been trying to familiarize myself with certain/interesting partial aspects from the field of data science.

One of my tools in this area is Power BI, in which I present various reports/results.

At the same time, I provide a comprehensive data dictionary for everyone, which describes every measure and all data. So basically a huge table where all measures and columns are listed with a description.

In addition, I have created a bus matrix that shows which facts can be combined with which dimensions. Both for data and measures.

Now I'm wondering if there are other methods and tools, like the Data Dictionary and the Bus Matrix, to make working with big and new data easier for everyone?

How do you do it in your company when you have to answer a new question with a completely new set of data?

Do you have best practices?

Can someone recommend a book/blog/pager on this?

,datascience,"First, just want to say that I really appreciate you for clicking on this and taking some time out to read this. I know that life has become somewhat of a circus these last six or so months and everyone has a different hand dealt to them, with many, many people having shittier hands than me.

I am a working at a start-up as the company's only data entry/analytics engineer/data scientist/analyst/machine learning engineer/basically all things data. Prior to covid, the company had a number of other revenue streams but since covid, the data analysis arm (me) has been essentially the only part of the business that can keep making money. My boss has been great. He gave me four months of full pay maternity leave (for non-US people, this is considered amazing by US standards). We had a freelancer that I trained to do certain aspects of my job take over for me, so during my maternity leave, we had bases covered. Once my maternity leave finished, I came back to work except, I have essentially been minimally productive. I don't have anyone helping me with childcare 9-5. My partner works in construction (so not a WFH type of job) so he's not able to help out during the day.

The nature of my work (as most people here probably will know) is time consuming and requires undivided attention. Writing or debugging code requires an attention to detail that is basically impossible to keep while caring for a 6 month old full time. Now, I know what you're thinking, ""extra\_noodles, why don't you get childcare?"" well, see I would, if there was an affordable childcare option that didn't require the use of public transit. We live in a large city where most people don't have cars, so the public transit system is/has been widely used. The public transit system has been one of the leading factors in the spread of covid here so I'm not comfortable exposing my child (who, at 6 months, has essentially only the immune system which has been provided by me) to a potential covid risk. From my research, while young kids aren't considered high risk, children under one year of age are, and I can't even imagine using a daycare right now.

So here's my question to you - if I were to take time off work until child is around 1 (this would be for approximately 6 months), how shitty do you think my job prospects would be, knowing that my current job (which I've had for about two years) has me doing many many things and specializing in none? How negatively would a 6 month break be seen for a data generalist? 

* I'm decent at code (but definitely not software engineer levels)
* I'm out of practice on SQL and other DB stuff 
* I'm generally pretty good at analysis/speaking with clients about data
* I haven't worked on a team in years
* I've essentially been prototyping with NLP and CV libraries for the last year and a half
* I'm pretty good with viz using plotly, tableau, excel (lol)

I have little idea what the landscape is for DS jobs right now because I've been in full time mom mode for the last 6 months and also full on getting ready for maternity leave for a month before that, so about 7-8 months of my brain essentially being close to blah with most things DS.

OR, alternatively, if you're in a similar position as I am, what's your game plan? How are you making this work? I'm spoken to my boss and while I can use freelancers for a lot of my job (data entry/cleaning), getting a freelance data scientist would be too expensive while keeping me on board. My salary isn't huge by DS standards, but it's a particularly large chunk of revenue because I'm basically responsible for the majority of contracts right now.

\- responsible for data analysis and predictive customer experience

\- responsible for accounting, recruitment of new additions

\- standardization of the ETL process, maintenance of the customer database

\- ensure that the data analysis processing meets specifications

requirements: 

\- modern classification, regression and dimensionality reduction techniques 

\- (some) experience with data science stack in R and/or Python

The description in the job ad sounded to me more like it&amp;#39;s a mix of data engineer/analyst. The main points are:&lt;br/&gt;
- responsible for data analysis and predictive customer experience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- responsible for accounting, recruitment of new additions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- standardization of the ETL process, maintenance of the customer database&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- ensure that the data analysis processing meets specifications&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;requirements: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- modern classification, regression and dimensionality reduction techniques &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- (some) experience with data science stack in R and/or Python  &lt;/p&gt;

My Scala script works flawlessly on local with mock parquet data. It isn't doing anything advanced - just identifying differences between two ostensibly identical dataframes, so using basic operations like counts, groupBys, joins, intersects, etc.

However it is struggling to finish running on our cluster with real data. Upon further inspection by logging into the cluster, I can see that my application did some counts that took less than a minute ...and proceeded to do nothing at all afterwards.

This idle state is endless as far as I can tell - I've seen it persist for over 24 hours. 

I can see that the counts on Line 142 and 143 were the last tasks that were performed. I've pasted an excerpt of my Scala code surrounding Lines 142 and 143 below.

I have a strong interest in deeply exploring data to extract insights and doing the whole idea of 'data driven decision making' in order to generate sales or for helping out with marketing strategies by segmenting users, but the problem here is that I can't define a business problem, I've just been running around with the data I have,  but I can't figure out how to use what I've gathered. For example, I have made a mathematical model for classifying users based on activity but I don't know how to move forward with it. I presented it to my CTO and he said we could use it to try and solve business problems but again, I don't know what the business problems are here. There's barely any communication with CEO/CMO so I end up being frustrated not being able to do anything. Is there anything I should take initiative of from my end to try and figure out how I could use the data we have in order to make decisions? I don't want to sound stupid approaching the CEO/CMO with nothing valuable to ask.

&lt;p&gt;I have a strong interest in deeply exploring data to extract insights and doing the whole idea of &amp;#39;data driven decision making&amp;#39; in order to generate sales or for helping out with marketing strategies by segmenting users, but the problem here is that I can&amp;#39;t define a business problem, I&amp;#39;ve just been running around with the data I have,  but I can&amp;#39;t figure out how to use what I&amp;#39;ve gathered. For example, I have made a mathematical model for classifying users based on activity but I don&amp;#39;t know how to move forward with it. I presented it to my CTO and he said we could use it to try and solve business problems but again, I don&amp;#39;t know what the business problems are here. There&amp;#39;s barely any communication with CEO/CMO so I end up being frustrated not being able to do anything. Is there anything I should take initiative of from my end to try and figure out how I could use the data we have in order to make decisions? I don&amp;#39;t want to sound stupid approaching the CEO/CMO with nothing valuable to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for those who are wondering, my app is a platform made for students in which they earn points by locking their phones, and can use those points to unlock offers at retail stores, restaurants, etc. And also provides a platform for students to apply to scholarships for universities.&lt;/p&gt;

I may have an opportunity for my employer to sponsor a master program in data science. I thought I’d ask your help on navigating the different programs out there and determining my best fit. I’m sure there are plenty of posts about programs but I was hoping some added background information on myself would potentially fine tune any advice.

Background on me: I am in data/market analytics, mostly in the building products manufacturer space in the US. I have almost 5 years experience in market research and almost 3 years experience in more general market analytics, mapping sales to economic data series, monitoring trends and using simple statistics to forecast one period out. I have a bachelors in marketing and have self taught some python programming skills (mostly using Jupyter notebooks),  as well as very light SAS software experience. I did not have a strong formal education in stats but I’m driven, and very eager to learn. 

I’d appreciate any guidance or advice on things to look for in a program! Thanks!

,datascience," Hello, I am having a bit of a trouble on getting my head around this.

I sell pants, and for this pants it exists 800 different types, based on a color code (red, green, etc.)and a style(straight, skinny, etc. ).

As you can imagine, I produce different amounts of types of pants, maybe blue skinny are the most manufactured, and yellow straight not so many.

For some pants produced in a day, I run some QA tests, one of them is the final weight and % material I used from its cloth to produce it, this is done to reduce waste. These are randomly selected tests.

I would to build a regression model using the pants weight, to get the % of material used, since getting the material used is time consuming and costly.

In order to check if there’s a correlation between weight and MU, should I get a correlation for each pants type(blue skinny), or could I do it based on all my population?

If I do it for each subpopulation, should I make sure to have enough sample of tests done for each one of them, and move forward only with the ones I have a 100% of the sample size?

At the end, in order to determine which model should I use, should I select it based on the behaviour of the whole population?

,datascience," Hey guys! Posting here as I place myself closer to data science than computer science/coding in general — but please point me to a more suitable subreddit for this type of question if you can.

TLDR: after watching some anime I thought that learning data science/programming has a lot in common with what protagonists undergo throughout the series. List of questions below.

&amp;#x200B;

1. In some stories, a hero has to master certain techniques (=coding/analysis methods), understanding of his enemies/different battling conditions (=domains&amp;different problems you can tackle), as well as train your spirit (=soft skills, e.g. grit to push through a problem, meta-skills like knowing how to approach a new problem/domain, etc). I wonder if you can make an effective learning path by approaching a DS education in the same way that a good anime takes you through a protagonist's development.  
 
2. Zooming in, one of the crucial skills you need to power through learning data science and get good at it is not quitting when you face a problem, e.g. you can't troubleshoot your code or you're stuck and can't find a solution. As I see it, the basic idea is: when you work in data science, there's always something you don't know. There are hundreds of layers between what you type in your IDE and the result that comes out: you work with libraries, then there's python code that you write, open-source tools, several layers of data architecture, infrastructure, your OS, algorithms, networking/data eng quirks and so on. Even seasoned data scientists know like 30% of the stack they utilize to get results. So it's okay to not know something, you just need to stay motivated to learn more, aiming for a point when you know like 80% of quirks that can happen when working on your chosen role &amp; domain. Explaining the importance of this aspect to a newbie is somewhat hard and it seems like a short comics might do better than a lecture here. Have you seen any related comics that get ideas like that across?  
 
3. This approach would work well for someone who is really passionate about mastering data science in detail like those anime characters master their craft (whatever that may be). I guess you can call it a samurai way or whatever when someone focused all their energy on a single thing and get incredibly good at it. Do you think this would work for the rest 90% of people who aren't ready to go all-in in that manner? I put myself in that 90%, and yet I feel really inspired by this type of character, so maybe it would work for the rest of us as well?  
 
4. I'm interested in this idea because it shows how much more there is to know about data science than most courses teach you. Most of those walks you through hard skills, usually without even connecting them to actual domains &amp; typical applications. Some bootcamps give you a chance to train your soft skills when completing small end-to-end projects in a team, but it still feels very limited. I'll be glad if someone proves me wrong or point to a methodology that touches on most of the points mentioned above.  
 

I wanted to do a proper intro, explaining how I end up thinking about this, but then decided it won't be really relevant here, since the anime is about cars and drifting and it'll probably look weird to expand on this in a data science subreddit. If you're curious to hear more, let me know in the thread and I'll provide full backstory.

,datascience,"Any auditors out here? 

I am in a company starting up a data team within the internal audit department at a large distribution/warehousing company. We have mainly done projects which are more akin to data analytics than data science, but looking for ideas to expand. 

Basically, our team needs to brainstorm business risks and use the data to show the business is adequately responding to that risk. For example, recently we have had projects where we did a fuzzy match on payments made in order to find duplicate payments, and analytics to show that employee facility access badges are consistently deactivated on the day of termination. But these are more akin to analytics rather than data science, and we want to get more applications which are closer to data science. 

I have some questions: 

1) Does anyone here do anything similar? Anybody in Internal Audit? 

2) What would be some good ideas for data science applications to pitch to my team? I realize I've given very little to work with, but I'm hoping many of these don't need to be company-specific. Our mandate really is quite broad and is as simple as identifying a business risk and using data to show if it is being mitigated properly.

,datascience,"I’m an only data scientist at my team. It is my first data science job (I went to grad school after working few years as a BI), and I guess many of you could imagine what I went through over several months— trying to find some doable projects and working on them with limited resources and knowledge. 

It’s been tough, but I learned a lot and I could see I was improving gradually. Looking back it’s been pretty good until today, when my manager announced that I’m going to train new team members transferred from other teams and potential new hires. She told me we will develop an internal data bootcamp for these new members with not familiar with modeling or advanced analytics.

My manager and other existing team members are not really technical people, and they were expecting me to take a lead and somehow make a plan to teach new hires and make them full stack data scientists.. (daunting, yeah?) 

She said it will be a great opportunity for me to be better data scientist and tried to persuade me saying how training experience and thing like that.

I was not sure how to react. Frankly I was overwelmed by all these sudden responsibilities and unrealistic expectations. So I told her that I’m still a junior data scientist and suggested her to give up this internal data science camp thing and hire people who are already data scientists. But she told me that these new team members are eager to learn and she does not have enough budget for hiring REAL data scientist like me. It was surprising to hear that because I’ve thought my salary is bit lower than average.. ($78K, southeast)

Questions

1. Is this really good opportunity to me? Some say teaching is the best way to learn something... but I’m not sure even where to start.

2. Is training and teaching non-technical colleagues common responsibility as a data scientist? I just feel it’s too much responsibility- with all the existing works. 

3. Do you think it is feasible plan for a junior data scientist? Training someone to be an expert. I’m already worried about blinds leading blinds situation.

TL;DR: My manager wants me (junior DS) to teach non-technical new hires/members to be data scientists to save money to hire real ones, any tips?

Edit:

I just read all the comments and realized I’m in deep shit... dang. But still would like to know if there’s any tips that could help me to somehow wisely deal with this situation

Edit2:

Talked with my manager about this. She likes my work and my capability, and she basically wants me to somehow teach other people to do my tasks, which are building dashboards, basic ML models, and analysis. She wants to grow my team and said no when I suggested her to hire senior/principal data scientist. She said I'm good enough, and she was relying on me. Instead, she will add 2-3 analysts to my team. In terms of raise or promotion, she mentioned if I could successfully do this (internal boot camp), I'd get a promotion (not 100% though).

It is my first data science job (I went to grad school after working few years as a BI), and I guess many of you could imagine what I went through over several months— trying to find some doable projects and working on them with limited resources and knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been tough, but I learned a lot and I could see I was improving gradually. Looking back it’s been pretty good until today, when my manager announced that I’m going to train new team members transferred from other teams and potential new hires. She told me we will develop an internal data bootcamp for these new members with not familiar with modeling or advanced analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My manager and other existing team members are not really technical people, and they were expecting me to take a lead and somehow make a plan to teach new hires and make them full stack data scientists.. (daunting, yeah?) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said it will be a great opportunity for me to be better data scientist and tried to persuade me saying how training experience and thing like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not sure how to react. Frankly I was overwelmed by all these sudden responsibilities and unrealistic expectations. So I told her that I’m still a junior data scientist and suggested her to give up this internal data science camp thing and hire people who are already data scientists. But she told me that these new team members are eager to learn and she does not have enough budget for hiring REAL data scientist like me. It was surprising to hear that because I’ve thought my salary is bit lower than average.. ($78K, southeast)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this really good opportunity to me? Some say teaching is the best way to learn something... but I’m not sure even where to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is training and teaching non-technical colleagues common responsibility as a data scientist? I just feel it’s too much responsibility- with all the existing works. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I have the output of two models and my task is to find the best way to combine this models so that I can maximze the approval rate in a certain product. I&amp;#39;ve been thinking on how to do that but the only way I think of is to a Grid Search over possible weights (in a train set) and choose the combination that returns the best approval rate in a valiation set. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this solution might be simple but maybe not the best. Do you know any strategy that I could use? I&amp;#39;ve been thinking on something like Operations Research but I can&amp;#39;t quite figure out the way. &lt;/p&gt;

,datascience,"I apologize but I actually have TWO questions. I hope that it’s allowed.

Scenario: There are 5 ads running on Google (advertising the same product) in July and there are 6 ads (all of which are advertising the same product but different target audience) running in August. The way this is shown in a dataset is that EACH ad has a line PER DAY with the number of conversions associated (like, clicking on a website button that implies the consumer is interested). 

Q1. Would it be correct to compare July data as a whole to August data or should I further segment them?

Q2. If I did compare by month, would these be paired or unpaired? My thoughts would be that these are paired since they are continuous and that they are both advertising on Google. But maybe I’m thinking incorrectly. If these are unpaired (because 1 month contains 5 ads while the other contains 2), then would it be correct to say that if I compared identical advertisements by month are paired?

First time poster here, looking for some advice or maybe accounts of your experience in the spatial data science realm! I'll try to make my explanation short and let my resume speak for itself (as much as possible. Critiques welcome! [https://imgur.com/XR5u3PB](https://imgur.com/XR5u3PB)).

A little non-resume background: early-to-mid stage in my career and want to carve out the relatively niche path combining geospatial and data science. In recent years I feel as though sharpened my open source python stack skills, applying concepts as I learn at an extremely accommodating engineering startup. 

Recently, I've been looking to take my career to the next step. I want to set up resume eyeing space-industry geospatial companies such as Planet Labs ([https://www.planet.com/](https://www.planet.com/)) , Descartes Labs ([https://www.descarteslabs.com/](https://www.descarteslabs.com/)), or Orbital Insight ([https://orbitalinsight.com/](https://orbitalinsight.com/)). 

While I'm happy where I'm at and make pretty good bucks currently, I've been considering applying to PhD programs in the Earth Sciences in hopes to bring the world of open source data science to the field and exercise some scientific 'freedom' per say. I've always felt like academia was right for me (I know this isn't an earth science group, but I'm talking applied DS here essentially).

At the same time I have also asked my company for a promotion track to Spatial Data Scientist, and seeing as though I'm more or less fresh at the applied ML stuff they are offering to pay for some online certification in Data Science if I choose to do so. 

My questions for you who have made it this far in this post are: What do you think? Particularly--do you know of any reputable online DS certification courses geared towards intermediate career folks such as myself? Conversely, do you reckon having a PhD in an applied science field can be beneficial for this career path as well?

Or, if that's the only way it works, I need to create a docker image that gets all that crap out of the way.

One of the blogs I came across (I forget the source) commented on the ""optimistically named"" functions in this package, such as \`use\_conda\_env()\`, which don't actually do what they are intended to. As of right now, there are 276 open issues on the package's GitHub. It's a hot mess.

I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Data Science and am currently doing honours (honours in comp sci) in which I'm doing research in machine learning. **I got into computers / tech because I love coding and building things with technology.**

I currently work (whilst studying) as a full stack web dev and it has really got me thinking about whether or not I want to become a software engineer. I've only ever worked in web dev and I don't know if it's just this job or what but I'm really not enjoying the work that much, it's just not as interesting as it was when I was first learning web dev.

I've always been interested in the data science stuff (and I love python a lot and machine learning) but I've always been kind of deterred from a career in this field due to the fact that it's not necessarily coding / tech orientated (this is the idea that I have in my mind). 

My worse fear is getting a job and not learning / using technical skills, not writing code and just using like excel or something. I've always thought of myself as an engineer rather than a scientist.

I'd love to engineer data science solutions, to work in both modelling and also writing the code to deploy those models (backend stuff), maintain them and build data pipelines etc that enable them. I love learning and using tools like docker and setting up cloud infra to get things to work. 

Is my idea of being a data scientist just wrong? I think my dream job would be a machine learning engineer right? A software engineer with a background in machine learning?

,datascience,"I'm currently transitioning to the DS field from an R background and have seen some conflicting information about the usefulness of R and I'm hoping to get more clarity from those of you working the field.

I've been working as a manufacturing engineer at a plant in a Dow 30 corporation for 2 years. When I joined I was told I can move around the company after 2 years. I realized I'm not growing in my role and I applied for an internal role as a data scientist. My direct manager is originally supportive but as I got close to getting an offer, upper management blocked my transfer because ""I've been doing a good job."" The hiring manager still wants me.

With the pandemic, I really don't want to work in a plant anymore. I started job searching and now got an offer as a data scientist from a lesser known company, with equal pay.

I got about a week or so before I need to make a decision. Should I just break the news to my employer that I got an offer but I wish to stay within the company and ask them to expedite my transfer request? It's either that, or I give them a 2 weeks notice soon, so they are going to find out anyway. Honestly, I prefer to stay within my current company.

,datascience,"First time on sub, sorry if this is an ‘ask google’ question, but I haven’t been able to find much literature on this.

At work we have a multiclass classification problem whereby we have to take millions of unlabelled documents and sort them into several categories. We use Keras and Python for this and it’s very effective.

We have run across an issue with some of our data coming in - a statistically relevant number of documents come in ‘stuck together’, as in the PDF file or scan containing the document actually contains 2 separate documents. This leads to two main problems where a document comes in where either:

1. the first X pages should be labelled ‘A’ but the next Y pages should be labelled ‘B’
2. The first X pages should be labelled ‘A’, the next Y pages should ALSO be labelled ‘A’, but needs to be delimited and treated as a separate unit.

At present, our only solution is to send a person in to eyeball documents and make sure they’re not ‘multiples’ before okaying them.

Right now we are exploring a Multi-labelling approach where we can say ‘the document is both A and B’. I am bearish on this approach because it’s not really like the holistic document is both A and B all the way through, it is actually exclusively A and then B.

I've heard sparse data as only having a very small portion of non zero elements. If a small portion of nonzero elements is the defining characteristic of sparsity could someone elaborate further on these question,

Does this have to do with some underlying ambient space which we imagine the graph embedded in and the graph actually being a function in that space? Just freestyling here.

Lastly,

* Why is sparse regularization, for example in matrix completion, called sparse?

,datascience,"Dear data science community,

As data science enthusiasts, a few months ago, we built a tool for data scientists to share their insights using visualizations and dashboards in pure Python or R and not requiring additional programming or front-end development.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fly6z5/publishing\_tracking\_and\_sharing\_data/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fly6z5/publishing_tracking_and_sharing_data/)

We received feedback from communities that a tool like this one should integrate a lot more data science frameworks. For example, a user should be able to push a matplotlib plot, a Tensorflow model, a plotly chart, a pandas data frame, and a presentation layer to fully-support it.   Supporting all the data artifacts and providing all the tools to work with them solely seems to be a very challenging if not impossible task.

Keeping this in mind, we have happily decided to open source the core of the product to the community

,datascience,"Hi all,

I’m a recent May graduate with my BA in Economics and Data Analytics. In May, I accepted a job with a pharmaceutical company for a data analyst role. The pay is hourly until I hit six months, it’s not bad but I know it’s low for the field. I’ll be honest, I took the job because I was at wits end trying to land something, especially in the current labor market climate. This role is really just organizing data to meet certain federal standards-nothing too “analyst”. 

I don’t hate my job, but I feel like I’m wasting my degree and knowledge while plugging code into SAS for 40 hours a week. I’ve wanted to be in a role where I am able to use my education as an analyst who actually gets to do some sort of analysis. 

I’ve always thought about this job as a placeholder until something better comes along. I plan on being here for around a year, because by then I’ll have some sort of experience. 

My question is, is it wrong for me to continue to look for a different job that aligns more with what I want to do? What else can I do while working full time to make me more attractive to employers?

,datascience,"Hey guys! I'm currently a software engineer and I've been thinking of switching to data science for some time now, but after doing tons of research I still can't figure out exactly what skillset one would need to be a good data scientist, and *exactly* what data scientists need to do on a day to day basis in terms of coding/bugs/problems. Although I enjoy coding, there are some things about being a software engineer I definitely don't enjoy, and I have it in my head that switching to data science will fix all my problems and kinda be the best of both world, in terms of doing the things I enjoy as well as getting rid of the things I do not enjoy about my current job. Hoping you guys can give some insight as to whether, based on the things I enjoy/dislike, you think I'd enjoy data science.

What I definitely dislike about software engineering:

1. Having to be available outside of work. My company doesn't exactly have the best processes in place, and we don't have pushing out code automated yet, so my boss is stuck waking up at 2am every 3 weeks to manually push out the code. Since he's leaving soon, I'll most likely have to help do that as well. In addition, I currently have to leave my phone on those nights to respond to/fix bugs if there are serious issues. I want a job where I can work reasonable hours (about 40 hours a week) and don't need to take my work home with me
2. Bugs! My team is relatively small, and although we do have a few QA people, they don't catch everything. I get such bad anxiety every time it's a release day, wondering if I'll have to wake up to a bunch of issues with my code not working or breaking existing things for our customers.
3. DevOps. I have the type of roll where I need to do a little of everything, including some devops types of tasks. That stuff kinda bores me tbh 

I have it in my head that data science will kinda be the best of both worlds, where I can use the skills I have/love (problem solving, logic, analytical thinking, math) but without the things I don't exactly love. Do data scientists need to worry about any of things mentioned above? If so, how, or what other problems come along with the job?

,datascience," Hi!

I am working on quite a challenging project that involves document classification. There are actually more than 15 classes, but for now, I am just working with the top 5 of them. The dataset is anyway severely imbalanced in that the top 2 classes constitute over 80% of the data.  
Another source of complexity is that, as you understand, the same document type can have various types of layouts depending on the company, and even within one company it might be different.

My initial attempt was based on treating documents as images, but this one didn't succeed since some documents are very similar visually so the visual-based classifier fails badly trying to tell the difference between such document types.

What approaches would you recommend with regard to NLP?  
I have tried tf-idf vectorizer + naive Bayes/linear SVM, but the results are not that great, and I believe such methods are far from being state-of-the-art as of today.

I know that a lot of projects use BERT transformers from hugging face for anything text-related and there are libraries like FastText that can handle classification pretty well.

Nevertheless, I would highly appreciate some guidance with regard to what approach could work well for imbalanced data and document classification in general.

,datascience,"The primary languages for analysts and data science are R and Python, but there are a number of ""no code"" tools such as RapidMiner, BigML and some other (primarily ETL) tools which expand into the ""data science"" feature set.

As an engineer with a good background in computer science, I've always seen these tools as a bad influencer in the industry. I have also spent countless hours arguing against them. 

Primarily because they do not scale properly, are not maintainable, limit your hiring pool and eventually you will still need to write *some* code for the truly custom approaches.

Also unfortunately, there is a small sector of data scientists who only operate within that tool set. These data scientists tend not to have a deep understanding of what they are building and maintaining.

However it feels like these tools are getting stronger and stronger as time passes. And I am recently considering ""if you can't beat them, join them"", avoiding hours of fighting off management, and instead focusing on how to seek the best possible implementation.

So my questions are:

* Do you use no code DS tools in your job? Do you like them? What is the benefit over R/Python? Do you think the proliferation of these tools is good or bad?

* If you solidly fall into the no-code data science camp, how do you view other engineers and scientists who strongly push code-based data science?

I think the data science sector should be continuously pushing back on these companies, please change my mind.

**Edit:** 
Here is a summary so far:

* I intentionally left my post vague of criticisms of no-code DS on purpose to fuel a discussion, [but one user adequately summarized the issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/i6hh5u/whats_your_opinion_on_nocode_data_science/g0wnyy4/). To be clear my intention was not to rip on data scientists who use such software, but to find at least some benefits instead of constantly arguing against it. For the trolls, this has nothing to do about job security for python/R/CS/math nerds. I just want to build good systems for the companies I work for while finding some common ground with people who push these tools.

* One takeaway is that no code DS lets data analysts extract value easily and quickly even if they are not the most maintainable solutions. This is desirable because it ""democratizes"" data science, sacrificing some maintainability in favor of value.

* Another takeaway is that a lot of people believe that this is a natural evolution to make DS easy. Similar to how other complex programming languages or tools were abstracted in tech. While I don't completely agree with this in DS, I accept the point.

* Lastly another factor in the decision seems to be that hiring R/Python data scientists is expensive. Such software is desirable to management.

,datascience,"Hi everyone! 

I'm currently a data analyst and am having a very difficult time in providing insights of any value. I currently analyze the effectiveness of a company x's advertising on Facebook. Normally, I would use Excel or SQL to analyze the data. However, I've been realizing that a lot of my insights are basic generalizations, like creating regression lines, finding which ad performed the best, which ad had the worst and best ROI, and the likes. Now, I wish to provide something related to statistics so that I'm able to bring better insights.

While studying statistics, my understanding is that a lot of tools like standard deviations, t-scores, z-scores, and so on require a dataset to be normally distributed. However, let's say I was analyzing the amount of clicks one advertisement received over the course of the year. The data has a very heavy right-skew due to the very high number of days the advertisement received ZERO clicks. 

What would be the best course to statistically analyze this data set? If I wanted to understand standard deviation, I know to transform it, since the SD of a skewed data doesn't say much. So, skewed, the SD is 3000. However, if I do a log +0.5, the SD is 3. If I apply the exp to it, then it's 25. Is this the right way to find SD on a right-skewed graph?

What else could I do so that I can start discovering cool things? I guess I lack the experience and guidance at my current company.

,datascience,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to create a predictive model that attempts to predict the likelihood of a product converting.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed that in creating models A and B, model B really outperforms model A using various performance metrics (such as MSE, R\^2). However, in practice, model A performs better in predicting behavior.

This really surprised me. When I looked at the differences in predictions, it seems that while in terms of pure prediction power model B is in fact better (getting the probability of conversion right), it tends to make more mistakes for large value items than model A. So its wins are offset by its losses.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems to me that I need to factor in the value of the product into the model as well. I'm not sure how to do that. Or perhaps modify the error function to use the value.

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

,datascience,"Hi, my problem at hand is a binary classification problem in the healthcare sector. I need to predict whether an order will be stockout or not. As for features, I have the date of order, the product ordered and some other information relative to the product (price, quantity ordered, etc.).

E.g. : 

|Product ID|Date of order|Quantity ordered|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1111|2014-01-01|1.0|

From my EDA, I have seen that the month the order was made can have an influence on the stockout.

As I'm doing my data split, I'm wondering if I should do backtesting for the test set, i.e, hold out some future data (so the last years worth of around 20% of my dataset) to evaluate on or if I'm better having an equal representation of each year in each split.

I need to predict whether an order will be stockout or not. As for features, I have the date of order, the product ordered and some other information relative to the product (price, quantity ordered, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g. : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Product ID&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Date of order&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Quantity ordered&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1111&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2014-01-01&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my EDA, I have seen that the month the order was made can have an influence on the stockout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#39;m doing my data split, I&amp;#39;m wondering if I should do backtesting for the test set, i.e, hold out some future data (so the last years worth of around 20% of my dataset) to evaluate on or if I&amp;#39;m better having an equal representation of each year in each split.  Since it&amp;#39;s not a problem like stock prediction (financially) where future values depend on past values, I am unsure if having an equal representation of each year in the splits would leak to data leakage.&lt;/p&gt;

,datascience,"I'll preface this post by noting the fact that I am not a DB admin, I do not have access to create ETL, stored procedures, or even tables. I work as an Analyst/Data Scientist with read access to write SQL scripts.

&amp;nbsp;

A lot of my job involves pulling data from our ERP systems to make sense of what is going on in our operations and supply chain. Through the years, I've built several SQL scripts that I would call my base SQL script that would answer basic business questions like: 

* What is my demand forecast? 
* What are the current open orders? 
* How much inventory do we currently have? 
* How much does part X cost?

&amp;nbsp;

From these scripts, I usually recycle these scripts with a SELECT INTO #temp_table depending on what questions need to be answered. Some examples would be:

* Is our inventory inflating?
* How did changing X affect our demand forecast (what-ifs analysis)?
* How are we performing to budget? 
* Are we over-ordering (supply and demand balancing)?
* Where are the opportunities to push orders into the next fiscal year?


&amp;nbsp;

So without contaminating the base SQL scripts to answer these questions, I usually save these in a new file and store in a project folder.

&amp;nbsp;

The problem I am running into is that, sometimes there are things that I've identified that could improve the accuracy of the data pulled or there are changes in some business process that will require an update of the base SQL scripts. As a result, I would need to go and update the base SQL scripts to reflect the new reality.

&amp;nbsp;

Now you can imagine, if I have several SQL scripts that were derived from the base SQL script, I'd need to go update all of those SQL scripts including the base SQL script as well. This is becoming a PITA and difficult to manage now. I am wondering if there is another less painful way of managing this.

I teach an intro data science class, and if I need to emphasize the engineering skills more, I *will* bring them into my class. However, there's just way too much noise to sort through:

* Most undergraduate and some graduate-level data science programs (and similarly-purposed programs, such as business analytics) I've seen do not require calculus I, even for admission to masters-level programs. **So does this mean that practitioners don't need to be aware of foundational concepts such as derivatives?**
* Some programs (usually Big-10) I've seen go all out on the math: requiring multivariable calculus, two semesters of linear algebra, and about 2-3 semesters of algorithms at the undergraduate level and requiring this background prior to admission at the masters level
* Programs that I've seen, particularly at the undergraduate and masters level, *do not seem* to emphasize data cleansing - not to mention data engineering skills. There is an undergraduate-level program that I am aware of which covers *Introduction to Statistical Learning* (ISL) in one semester toward the end of the program.

,datascience,"This is anecdotal and has worked for me, I hope it works for you! 

1. Use arrows 
I tend to have so many hot fire ideas and solutions pouring out of my brain, Losing scope of a project. I remedied this by drawing arrows from IDEA to SOLUTION. Using my short attention span to my advantage, I could pour my mind out on paper and link those ideas to solutions, so whenever I need a structure, the arrows offer visual aid; removing the pesky anxious feelings. 

2. Writing diarrhea
Get everything out. When you’re flooded by thoughts, write down one word that associates with that thought. Keep going. You’ll run out of things to write down. If some of these things make sense to you, refer to 1. And draw some arrows! 

3. Tree diagrams and prune
When you’re overwhelmed by what you want to do first, using your word diarrhea and arrows, build from those components. Look at those connections, what makes it achievable to go from a to b? Extend the edges from component a to all it’s children, likewise for b, c and so on. 
COME BACK TO IT AT A LATER TIME!!! This is important. Come back to your mess of words with structured arrows and begin pruning. You may realize that neural net you wanted to program uses too much time! However maintain the links from left to right, from idea to product. 
Here’s an example: 

Idea: I want to predict house prices, product: send as analysis tool to sales team. 

From idea
        Program in python
        Program in c++ 

From product 
       Deliver as REST API 
       Deliver as an excel spreadsheet with formula 


Now you come back at a later time. You notice that you don’t want to program it in c++, and you want to deliver it as a function for excel. Prune that tree. 

4. Meditate at work
Take time off to spend 10 minutes outside or in another room practicing your breath. Keep it simple, think of your breath and let your natural thoughts come in. Try to go back to your breath. 

These worked wonders for me. I spend every morning drawing arrows! We have trello to keep track of our projects, but I’d still get lost anyway. The visual aid of an arrow works wonders for me, and I honestly can’t explain that, however, try it for yourself. 

Writing things down feels like I’m taking a massive shit after a heavy night of curry, once it’s out I feel so relieved.

,datascience,"I""m an analyst, but just recently,  our teams job title got changed to ""Data scientist"" because we sometimes try to answer business questions by building predictive models.

The models I do build are one-off models.  code the model, look at the coefficients, answer the question, and move on.  I dont deploy the models or anything.

,datascience,"If you’re a DS in a marketing dept, your work is basically laid out for you clearly. Finance, pretty clear. Risk management, clear. Product, Human Resources, call center, education, all clear. Medicine, health, ecology, biology, engineering, sales. All clear.

IT... not so clear, and I don’t mean a data scientist who serves the entire organization but is nested under the IT department for some reason. I’m talking about an IT department that is trying to improve their service by bringing in a DS to solve their (business) problems. Sure, there might be some interesting work in cyber security, but you won’t be doing that for a run of the mill IT department. They’ll just buy a product/service from somewhere with way more data resources to make good decisions from. At best maybe KPI and SLA metrics, depending on the org. That kind of thing takes a few hours at best, not enough to fill a roll. More likely you’d be doing data engineering and dev ops, which are not data science.

,datascience,"Hi all,

I have about 1 year of data science experience and about 1+ years of data analyst experience (total 2.5 YOE). I'm grateful to receive two offers so I am curious about fellow data science practitioners' opinions here.

I'm located in an Asian city and I received an offer from ByteDance as a data analyst, which is the parent company of TikTok. The compensation package is actually higher than the data scientist offer from a top Asian bank that is going all-in on digital transformation.

From what I gathered during the interview, the data analyst will be insight generation and building the analytics framework for the particular business function in the APAC HQ from scratch. However, there would be no predictive modeling (even though this role would be involved in building the data pipelines for the predictive models). As for the data scientist role, there are interesting projects involving NLP, marketing analytics, and customer segmentation / churn prediction, customer geo-targeting. The bank's main operations are in Southeast Asia, China, Hong Kong, India, and Australia.

From a career development viewpoint, ByteDance offers better prestige and the exit opps to other tech firms would be great. As for the bank DS, it would expose me less to the tech world but the projects would allow me to develop my skills in machine learning.

People may point to the potential banning of TikTok in US, but in Asia, TikTok is still wildly popular, and ByteDance is still one of the highest-valued unicorn in the world. Even without the US and Indian market, TikTok is still wildly successful.

,datascience,"Some of the most important kinds of information for data science are encoded in graphs. Organizational information, transactional information, hierarchical information, knowledge graphs.

The math of characterizing and working with graphs is well documented and understood, but as far as I can tell, not well implemented in data science tools.

The problem seems to be memory explosions as low-level engines sequentially calculate Cartesian products of every possible relation and then filter for the specific types of relations you happen to be looking for. Do this over more than a few hops and you'll bring any small or medium sized system to its knees.

This problem has obviously been solved by people who work with truly big graphs (Google and Facebook and friends), but I suspect that at least some of the time they are doing it simply with brute force, and anything more clever than this they keep proprietary.

This matters because you can actually represent graph information as a matrix, and  (some) matrix manipulations are extremely well implemented with open source software and accelerated by GPU hardware. You still have a risk of a memory explosion for dense graphs, but you've got built-in ways to serialize these kinds of calculations so that you're just slowing down, not crashing. 

The most important bit is that real-world graphs are more often than not sparse matrices. Sparse matrices can be serialized with a triplet structure, that is extremely efficient. There are both R and Python implementations of this available.

It should be possible to write wrapper functions that can take graph data structures as Node set, Edge set and transform them efficiently to sparse matrix triplets. It should also be possible to implement the most common graph algorithms to work as matrix operations in a way that is suitable for GPU acceleration.

,datascience,"Hi DS community,

Just wanted to thank you all for you help and questions, this group has been invaluable for me studying for interviews. Over the last month, I have been interviewing around at various companies and in the last couple days have received two offers. I don’t know exactly what “market rate” is for data science, so I was hoping for some help evaluating the better offer as I may have to make a decision on this while still in the pipeline at other companies so it’s unlikely I can wait to see if I get more offers or what they would be. 

This role is remote (I’m currently based in Dallas and company is not but they don’t mind where I work).

The offer is 160k base, 15% annual bonus, 5.5k annually towards tuition (I’m working on my MS part time with Georgia Tech OMAnalytics), 6% 1:1 401k match, 4 weeks vacation, 2 weeks worth of company holidays.

As far as my background, I have 4 YOE and have a dual BS in Math &amp; Econ, like I mentioned also currently part time enrolled in the Georgia Tech online masters. 

The team and would be manager seem awesome. I really clicked with the manager and it seems like the company cares and that they’re genuinely good people. 

As far as cost of living, I could stay in Dallas, which is definitely lower than the Bay Area or NYC. 

I’m in the pipeline at other companies, but is this offer worth taking and dropping out of the running elsewhere? I suppose I could take it and continue interviewing, but I really would like to avoid that because I did have a strong connection and wouldn’t want to leave them high and dry.

,datascience,"I have worked in a few finance companies now in the UK where the model-building framework tends to have a few common characteristics.

For example:

* Logistic and linear regression are almost always used
* In classification, features are manually binned and replaced by their WOE (basically impact-encoding is used for all features)
* Variable selection: removing correlated features -&gt; filter method to exclude some features -&gt; stepwise feature selection, with strict p-value-based criteria for features entering/leaving the model
* The final model rarely has more than 10 features (selected from a pool of 200-300)

These practices seem *very* common in finance talking to more experienced people on my team. My manager is very open to modernizing and increasing the flexibility of our approach, but based on conversations i've had with senior managers and directors they tend to be more skeptical.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if we were suggest implemeting a non-linear/ensemble approach (e.g. lightgbm/xgboost/random forest) with 100 features, common concerns might be:

1. **Stability** \- Flexible models with many features produce 'less-stable predictions'
2. **Deterioration** \- Flexible models with many features may perform better initially but will degrade in performance much faster and require re-training/re-development more frequently
3. **Diagnosis** \- If something goes wrong, it's harder to figure out why
4. **Interpretability** \- There is a real trade-off between performance and parsimony, and that a simpler method is worth sacrificing (sometimes considerable) cross-validation/test/future data accuracy

I personally haven't seen evidence to support 1, 2 &amp; 4. It particularly makes very little sense when we might include externally sourced features in our 'simple model' that are outputs of another predictive model, so these 'individual features' aren't so simple and are basically a function of 300 others! I think that 3 is a more legitimate concern, but that approaches like SHAP or simply monitoring changes in features over time could help with this.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a big paper-reader but a lot of [Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1009213726) resonated with things I have seen in industry. I suspect that many of these concerns and best practices probably originate from a mixture of explanatory statistics and tradition in credit risk modeling. I also think that a certain amount of it might be hearsay or a fear of the unknown.

Having said that, these directors have decades of practical modeling experience combined (most of it follows this classical credit-risk/banking framework) and are very intelligent and knowledgeable. On the other hand, I am in the first few years of my career and am still learning all the time.

I am curious if there has been much research on this topic, if you guys have found (in your experience) any/all of these concerns to be legitimate, and how you might approach alleviating them if they aren't.

,datascience,"Booz Allen Hamilton is a legitimate company, but I believe someone is posing as them to scam job seekers.

This morning, I got an email for a remote Data Scientist position with BAH. The job description sounded legitimate and it said ""We successfully reviewed your resume and it has been approved for an virtual screening test/interview by Booz Allen Hamilton Inc, for the position of ***Data Scientist*** (REMOTE)."" They also asked me to confirm my name and city listed on my resume, which I thought was strange, but not out of the realm of possibility. The person listed to contact has a LinkedIn profile with 300 connections and is listed as a BAH employee.

I said I was interested in the interview and that I had availability tomorrow. A few hours later, they emailed me with the screening test and let me know I had three hours to complete it. Kind of a dick move, but okay. It consisted of mostly technical questions related to machine learning algorithms.

I sent my answers back to them and received a reply stating they had gotten my answers, would ""forward the \[answers\] to the Hiring Board for their decision,"" and would get back to me with ""feedback from the Board's decision in about an hour or more."" I did not reply. At this point, there were a few warning signs, but nothing overtly obvious that this was a scam.

30 minutes later, I received another email stating that ""I am glad to inform you that due to your level of experience and your working skills, the company has decided to hire you as one of our ***Data Scientists.""***  They wanted my full name, address, email, and phone number for the HR hiring letter. They would also send me a check ""to set up your mini office by purchasing the office equipment and software needed to start your training and work."" They also said I would undergo a few days' training at $20 an hour and then work itself would be $60 an hour.

I was very suspicious at this point, and eventually found [this article](https://adage.com/article/agency-news/job-offer-agency-fake/314615) from two years ago detailing a scam with almost the same details but from a different company. This has confirmed to me that it is indeed a scam, which is disappointing given the current job market.

&lt;p&gt;I sent my answers back to them and received a reply stating they had gotten my answers, would &amp;quot;forward the [answers] to the Hiring Board for their decision,&amp;quot; and would get back to me with &amp;quot;feedback from the Board&amp;#39;s decision in about an hour or more.&amp;quot; I did not reply. At this point, there were a few warning signs, but nothing overtly obvious that this was a scam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;30 minutes later, I received another email stating that &amp;quot;I am glad to inform you that due to your level of experience and your working skills, the company has decided to hire you as one of our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data Scientists.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  They wanted my full name, address, email, and phone number for the HR hiring letter. They would also send me a check &amp;quot;to set up your mini office by purchasing the office equipment and software needed to start your training and work.&amp;quot; They also said I would undergo a few days&amp;#39; training at $20 an hour and then work itself would be $60 an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very suspicious at this point, and eventually found &lt;a href=""https://adage.com/article/agency-news/job-offer-agency-fake/314615""&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; from two years ago detailing a scam with almost the same details but from a different company. This has confirmed to me that it is indeed a scam, which is disappointing given the current job market. I have been looking for a job for a while now and it&amp;#39;s unfortunate that people are trying to take advantage of that, especially now. I wanted to post this in case anyone else had received this email and to let them know it&amp;#39;s not legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;

,datascience,"Hi folks, I need your advice.

I came across a very poor quality paper recently, it was oublished in a reviewed journal. I don't want to tell which one was it, as I feel that wouldn't be a great thing to do. The paper itself was written by a professor from a more or less well respected business school. The analysis however is not only poor (underreporting results, which are just a correlation r value plus a line on a graph), it is exactly the type which makes a lot of people look at quantitative social science and political science as a child's playground.

The paper is based on a classification algorithm, which is so poorly documented, that you can only get any kind of accuracy from one single graph (nothing in the text), which actually shows that almost half of the cases were classified with an error so large, that it could span across three categories. The classification is based on a range, where classes span 5 units of measurement. The error for ~46% of classified data points is at least 5.5, so theoretically this is as ambigous as it gets. The algorithm is only documented in 4 pages, so there is literally nothing to go on. The first paper cites the short paper, and links to a google drive for the source code, but the link throws a 404, despite the paper coming out a week ago.

I have nothing against the author, I have nothing in making them retract the paper. I've been working in data modelling for years now, and linear models are my specialty, so I'm fairly certain I'm right. I'm also active academically, and as a person who tries to legitimize quantitative social sciences, I think papers like this hurt us a great deal.

Is it a dick move if I voice my concerns to the journal?

I work as a data-lead at a moderately (medium/large) sized civil office. My team and I have been tasked with the development of a data warehouse from scratch. The data we mainly work with are mostly stored on-prem. The data is not big the sense that they are long and frequently measured, but rather big in the sense that they are varied and ""wide"". 

What is both a blessing and a curse for us is that we are (almost) free to choose our data architecture (that is, what kind of database, ETL tool esc.)

The team consists of data scientists who all are experienced and very capable in R. So the team is set up to use R as a weapon of choice. For what it's worth, R has been my weapon of choice for more than a decade now. 

With the introduction of tidyverse and dbplyr to R - it is my opinion that R can now serve a go-to ETL tool for building a data warehouse. 

What I would like to ask this community is: Is there anyone here who has experience building a data warehouse (or a virtual data warehouse) using R as the main ETL tool? What are the pros-and-cons? What pitfalls could lie ahead that I am not seeing - me being very biased towards using R?

,datascience,"I am something of an amateur genealogist. In genealogy, when researching a family history and/or ancestors, as you go further back in time, you sometimes (or eventually) hit what’s called a 'brick wall'. That's the term for when you are unable to proceed any further in determining who somebody was, who their parents were, where or when they were born or died, etc. This is often the result of insufficient record keeping. As you can imagine, as you go further back in time, record keeping becomes more and more of a problem. 

As a result of a brick wall I’ve hit, I’ve decided to try to attack my ‘brick wall’ in something of a different angle - with data science/analytics. I’m not a data scientist. I have some experience with web analytics (implementation, analyzing, and reporting), but certainly not at the level of the posts that I see in this sub. 

My hypothesis is that I can use known social relationships/networks/interactions in a specific region within the U.S. across 70-80 years (multiple generations) to try to answer some of my questions, the main one being, “of this selection of candidates, who is most likely (and to what likelihood) to be this person’s father and mother?”

The data that I have includes (1) the entirety of the Federal Census records for three counties where all family are known to have lived, (2) church birth records, if/when available for churches within those counties, (3) marriage indexes (which do not include birthdates) for many or most marriages within those three counties, and (4) an incomplete, but sizable, collection of tax records.

What I’m thinking is that of the people who interacted with each other, whether that’s as bondsmen in a marriage, witnesses at birth/marriage, people who lived near each other, or people who were in some other way a part of each other’s social network - their parents also interacted with each other in some or similar ways. Friends of family span across multiple generations. Person A is best buds with Person B because, in part, their parents were best buds. I have seen this several times earlier/later in my own family tree, and it’s pretty interesting to see this insight. 

So, I wanted to reach out to ask for any suggestions/advice anybody might have about how I should go about this. I would appreciate if you can comment or PM.

In genealogy, when researching a family history and/or ancestors, as you go further back in time, you sometimes (or eventually) hit what’s called a &amp;#39;brick wall&amp;#39;. That&amp;#39;s the term for when you are unable to proceed any further in determining who somebody was, who their parents were, where or when they were born or died, etc. This is often the result of insufficient record keeping. As you can imagine, as you go further back in time, record keeping becomes more and more of a problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of a brick wall I’ve hit, I’ve decided to try to attack my ‘brick wall’ in something of a different angle - with data science/analytics. I’m not a data scientist.

How can one calculate True Positivity Rate (TPR) &amp; FPR by checking if values of a discrete variable (features) are above a threshold which has been calculated by dividing the range (Max-Min) of the feature in 100 equidistant points?

Here is the resultant ROC curve

,datascience,"When Implementing custom loss function how to make it invariant to the `batch size`. For example lets say `dice loss` is being implemented. The formula does not clarify how to deal with the `batch size`. It is worth noting that according to this formula, the value of `loss` will increase if the `batch size` is increased. The obvious intuition would be to normalize the `loss` value using `batch size`. I have two question in this context.

1. Is it theoretically valid to normalize the `loss` using the `batch size`?
2. How to normalize? 

* For example, In case of image the `tensor` at hand is `4D`. The `dice score` / `loss` can be calculated for _each image_ and _each class_ resulting into a `2D` tensor.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now the aggregated `loss` can be calculated as the sum of all elements in the `2D` tensor divided by `batch size`.

* Alternatively, we can ignore the `batch size` from the beginning and generate per class `loss` in a `1D` `tensor`. Finally sum the elements and divide by `batch size` to get the aggregated `loss` value.

**Is there any fundamental difference between these two approaches? Which one is correct (if any)?**

,datascience,"Since moving into the DS field roughly 4 years ago, and having worked on/for a handful of different teams/companies, I think one of the best skills I've picked up is being able to tell people what CAN'T be done.

It sounds pessimistic on face value, but in industry I find it to be a very practical skill. In my experience, upper management or outside departments have an overinflated perception of the capabilities of data science in general, but also data science capabilities within the organization. 

I've found this to be true working for very large corporations as well as non-profits. In my opinion, being able to honestly and succinctly articulate the realistic capabilities of the team can drastically improve efficiency and reduce wasted time/energy. 

Again, in my experience, explaining in blunt terms what can/ can't be done to non-technical or not-very-technical is the way to go. I typically start out very broad and explain why what their asking is a bad idea. If that doesn't work, I get more technical and also try to put it into a dollars/man-hours cost benefit type of analysis. Typically once you explain technically why it can't be done OR why it doesn't make sense in terms of money or time, then people start to understand better.

Using this type of strategy from the very outset is the best way to go. The last thing you want to do is overpromise and underperform.

An example, since this is a bit ambiguous, I was working on a team and we were contacted by another department to ""create an algorithm that sorts our emails into various categories."" They had heard from someone that text classification could save them time... Or something like that is what I gathered. Our team knew it was a BS request right off the bat, but my boss was overruled by a superior within the company. We had several (useless) meetings with them where they spilled out their reasons why they needed this to be done.

Long story short, it turns out that they only had 500 emails and there were no real defined categories to put them into. It wasn't until we explained to them that 1) this model would take longer than just going thru the emails by hand 2) would likely not be very accurate and 3) basically cost a teams worth of hours to complete.

,datascience,"Hello. This is a genuine question from a professional video editor with absolutely no knowledge of data science, and this may be the wrong sub altogether. I have noticed that when the new case numbers (in California for example) show a slowing rate of decline, depicted by a noticeably less steep angle, two or more times in a short space of time (less than a week), this seem to come before a rapid rise in case numbers. I may add an image in the comments to show what I mean but for now hopefully I can describe this without an image.

,datascience,"Hi r/datascience! 

So recently I've been battling with an interesting modelling project. The task is to create a descriptive model to help determine drivers of a given outcome. Initially, I went with decision trees as these had a good visual element to them and worked well for a previous project whereby one could also determine a 'profile' or set of attributes via the decision paths to one of the leaf nodes leading to a likely outcome determined by the model.

However, I am now dealing with a problem which has many categorical features (hence partial dependency plots are not exactly something applicable) and is more akin to a multiclass problem (I could split it into one vs all binary classification, but would prefer not to). My current thinking is to use catboost (I tried decision trees on this multiclass problem in R and the optimization procedure is too slow for this), which gives good results, but alas it is an ensemble method. I could grab the first decision tree, yes, but it is not the full picture. I have tried Shapley values for this as well, and come up with building some groups of attributes that are influential by using the attributions from the Shapley values. I won't go into detail but rather ask the following question:

Suppose you have a model which yields good performance. Sure, you can retrieve some feature importance from it. But, suppose you want to build a profile let's call it (could be a profile of a lead, or product) of attributes from your features which are very likely to lead to this outcome, as determined by this model. How would you proceed in doing so? Do you know of any techniques, packages etc. which handle this problem? Do you propose any other models which are good with this?

,datascience,"Hi,

I'm sure this is a situation many of you have come across before, and I was wondering what your thoughts were. Many times when I'm tuning my hyperparameters, I'll find that the model with the best CV error is actually very overfit when comparing the in-fold vs out-of-fold training error. For example, I just ran an xgboost model, and the parameters with the best CV error resulted in a out-of-fold logloss of 0.451, and an in-fold logloss of 0.405. That in-fold logloss is 11% lower than the out of fold, which seems excessive. If I created a model with these parameters, I would expect it to be overfit. However, I would also expect it to generalize well based on logloss criteria.

So, what are the general thoughts on how 'different' in-fold vs out-of-fold errors should be? I know there isn't a formula or any hard set rules - I was just wondering how people handled situations like this.

,datascience,"Hi,

I know the question is kinda dumb but I am trying to learn a skill/strategy that is usually not taught in school/books/moocs.

I have heard a lot that one of the best ways of learning is to ""learn it on the job"" specially when it comes to machine learning and data science (given their rapid changes).

I, however, have a hard time understanding how should I learn on the job? Assume you are given a deep model that you have not worked with / studied before, or working on a data pipeline that you have not worked with before.

How do you go about actually get the project done, while also learning it well? How do you prioritize? How do you divide your time into learning, doing, searching, etc? If you have any other strategies please do share it as well.

&lt;p&gt;I feel as though I’m “proficient”, however at the same time it’s weird saying that as it almost feels like I know more of the “what” and “where” to look to solve error codes as opposed to just being able to solve them off the top of my head. Same with using different packages; I know where to look to find what I need moreso than what I have memorized off the top of my head. My question for those who consider themselves proficient in these languages: is this common for you as well? Am I still much more novice than I am proficient? For context, I’ve used R most days for the last year or so, so I do consider myself to have a solid grasp of it, I just feel like Ive almost learned how to manage error codes/problems more efficiently since I began more than I have memorized all of the intricate codes.&lt;/p&gt;

The Data Science workflow starts with a business problem or objective that needs to be resolved. The data science team takes the problem at hand, and works through different stages to explore, clean and analyze the data to produce ML models that can solve business

1.   Data Cleaning turns the source “raw data” into a “clean” form. This takes a significant amount of time because most raw data is unclean, meaning steps need to be taken to improve the quality and develop it into a format that machines can interpret and learn from.

2.   Feature Engineering: Feature engineering is the process of taking a dataset and identifying explanatory variables  or “ features” that can be used to train a machine learning model for predictive analytics. Often, this involves merging data spread across multiple tables and gathered into a single table with rows containing the observations and features in the columns. This step is generally the most intensive part of the workflow, from a human perspective, as it requires a careful understanding of the problem and domain knowledge.

3.   Model Selection, Model Training and Deployment Model selection plays a crucial role in building good machine learning models. ML model selection requires selecting the best hyperparameters and algorithmic selection. A lot of model selection is now performed through automated software packages. Models are tested by exposing them to new data, providing an unbiased estimate of its performance.

I have experience in feature engineering mostly in a manufacturing domain.

I’m not aware of any conferences or societies around this topic specifically.  Does anyone know of any or are interested in the idea of creating one like a Feature Engineering Society?

My opinion is that feature engineering is one of the most important and vast layers of data science and ML.  A conference like this would help to expand the knowledge and collaboration.

,datascience,"Hi, I am working on predicting wich customers will churn and need some help.

I am having doubts on how to approach the creation of the data set. Even asking the question is somewhat difficult to explain for me.

&amp;#x200B;

We have 250,000 clients, 1,500 churn every month, that is, approximately 0.6% per month churn . It is very unbalanced.

I have the data for 18 months, that means that I have 18 times the database of 250,000 clients (4.5M rows) and marked the 27,000 clients who have churned those 18 months (1,500 churn \* 18 months).

Of those 4.5 million records, there are many repeat customers, since if they did not churn , they will remain in the database the following month.

My question is how do I build the dataset. I suppose I have to select the 27,000 cases that churned as the class to be predicted, but how do I go about selecting the records for the classes that did not churn?

I was thinking of transforming the non-churn class to unique registers, but what register do I take? The last record, the first, random?

What other approach would youfollow or have you followed in similar cases?

&amp;#x200B;

I also found in kaggle someone with a similar question, but without answers, maybe if my question is not understood you can read a different wording.

Thank you!",t2_573vvx2f,False,,0,False,How do you build your data set to predict customer churn?,[],r/datascience,False,6,discussion,0,,,False,t3_htp9vl,False,dark,0.89,,public,49,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,49,,False,self,1595114010.0,,[],{},,True,,1595139151.0,text,6,,,text,self.datascience,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I am working on predicting wich customers will churn and need some help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am having doubts on how to approach the creation of the data set. Even asking the question is somewhat difficult to explain for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have 250,000 clients, 1,500 churn every month, that is, approximately 0.6% per month churn . It is very unbalanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the data for 18 months, that means that I have 18 times the database of 250,000 clients (4.5M rows) and marked the 27,000 clients who have churned those 18 months (1,500 churn * 18 months).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of those 4.5 million records, there are many repeat customers, since if they did not churn , they will remain in the database the following month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is how do I build the dataset. I suppose I have to select the 27,000 cases that churned as the class to be predicted, but how do I go about selecting the records for the classes that did not churn?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of transforming the non-churn class to unique registers, but what register do I take? The last record, the first, random?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What other approach would youfollow or have you followed in similar cases?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found in kaggle someone with a similar question, but without answers, maybe if my question is not understood you can read a different wording.&lt;/p&gt;

,datascience,"Hi,

I am working in a company as data analyst / database manager and I would like to slowly shift to ""real"" data science.

I have very solid SQL (T-SQL to be precise) skills, Excel from A to Z and also its VBA scripting language I am able to programm Web Crawler / Web Scrapers, and other useful automation staff. About analysis,  I am no statistician (I studied economy) but I am a statistic enthusiast and at work I regularly use techniques like multiple regression, logistic regression to build scoring for customer groups etc,.. Other than that, the ""regular"" statistics (T-test for difference between groups, variation analysis, etc....) is also something I use.

I would describe myself more expert in the Database side  of the job though (50% of my working time I write queries in SQL).

What would be the next usefull skill I should learn? Time is not a problem, but the things I would like to learn should help me slowly switch to a proper ""data science"" role. I would love to learn techniques that are relevant for marketing purposes.

Any suggestion is highly appreciated! Thanks!

,datascience,"Hi everyone,

I'm one of the developers that have been working on a package that enables faster hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models. We recognized that sklearn's GridSearchCV is too slow, especially for today's larger models and datasets, so we're introducing [tune-sklearn](https://github.com/ray-project/tune-sklearn). Just 1 line of code to superpower Grid/Random Search with

* Bayesian Optimization
* Early Stopping
* Distributed Execution using Ray Tune
* GPU support

Check out our blog post here and let us know what you think!

[https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/gridsearchcv-2-0-new-and-improved-ee56644cbabf](https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/gridsearchcv-2-0-new-and-improved-ee56644cbabf)

&amp;#x200B;

Installing [tune-sklearn](https://github.com/ray-project/tune-sklearn):

`pip install tune-sklearn scikit-optimize ray[tune]` or `pip install tune-sklearn scikit-optimize ""ray[tune]""` depending on your os.

Quick Example:

    from tune_sklearn import TuneSearchCV
    
    # Other imports
    import scipy
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier
    
    # Set training and validation sets
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=11000, n_features=1000, n_informative=50, 
                               n_redundant=0, n_classes=10, class_sep=2.5)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=1000)
    
    # Example parameter distributions to tune from SGDClassifier
    # Note the use of tuples instead if Bayesian optimization is desired
    param_dists = {
       'alpha': (1e-4, 1e-1),
       'epsilon': (1e-2, 1e-1)
    }
    
    tune_search = TuneSearchCV(SGDClassifier(),
       param_distributions=param_dists,
       n_iter=2,
       early_stopping=True,
       max_iters=10,
       search_optimization=""bayesian""
    )
    
    tune_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
    print(tune_search.best_params_)

The problem is that we often have a scenario where a piece of work will
involve multiple steps, they're to be delivered in a pretty short space
of time, and changes are often requested later on (""*_can you filter by x%
instead of y% for z?*"", or whatever).

What has been done previously is that an issue is created for a piece of
analysis and everything is done there - the problem is that it's really damn
hard to manage all the commentary / defining scope / seeing what needs to be
done when everything is in one place (imo). So - instead of this - each
subtask of a particular piece of a project is broken out into a separate
issue, each with a particular deliverable.

This makes sense - but where it becomes a bit trickier is when I might want
to be able to borrow a bit of code from one issue to another, if they're all
siloed this makes things harder to do. So, I guess I would want to merge them
into the ""main issue"" repeatedly, I'm not really sure though.

So - in this scenario I have something like

```
├── master
│   ├── analysis_project
│   │   ├── task_1
│   │   └── task_2
│   │   └── task_3
│   │   └── task_4
│   │   └── task_5
...
```

And I'm asking - if you were to do something along these lines how would you
approach it?

You could have a branch off `analysis_project`, and just use the issues on
github to document the work being done on the tasks, but not actually have
branches for them.

Or, you could have a branch for `task_1`, `task_2`, `task_3` etc and when you
feel the task is complete (or near enough ish) merge it back into
`analysis_project`? How would you handle changes to the tasks in this setup?

Maybe there's an established workflow? That'd be nice.

notebooks are used a lot but generally I try and use notebooks as a
luxurious `breakpoint()`, as soon as there's code that's code a reasonable
structure it's going into a module.

&gt; How you perform your analysis and reporting is going to have a huge influence

Yeah. So, a common scenario is that something will spin up very quickly (eg
&lt;24 hours notice and the project is live) and can have delivery within 2
weeks or so. Typically there can be exploratory stuff, data cleaning /
processing and then plotting/analyis of the data. Not expecting anything to
seem too unusual there, but what I don't know really is the way to structure
things for this.

Say the work comes in and it's `X Analysis`, then there's a story (issue)
created `Analysis of Y for X`, which contains an outline of the work that
needs to be done there might be a story created as:

```

Story S1

need to generate analysis for X, some data is located at &lt;somewhere&gt; and 
needs to be integrated into &lt;something&gt;, after which X needs EDA of &lt;y1 y2
y3&gt;, dead line for this is &lt;date&gt;.
```

Now - work could procede in a few ways afaik (there might be others too,
perhaps better!)

* 1 - create a branch `b0` for `S1`, and carry out all work within this branch
* 2 - Break the story out into separate tasks, and write up work for each of those tasks on the github issue, but keep all code within branch `b0`
* 3 - Break the story out into separate tasks, and write up work for each of those tasks on the github issue, for each task create a branch, so `b1 : gather data initial checks`, `b2 : integrate data into &lt;something&gt;`, `b3 : eda of &lt;y1 y2 y3&gt;`, once each task is completed merge into `b0`

Of the above I'm pretty sure that I don't like `1`, having *everything* on a single branch. For `2` and `3` I'm not too sure. `3` feels as though it would be the most ""textbook"", but there are scenarios where things are moving quickly and having *everything* on separate branches feels as though it might start getting a bit confusing, and if the client requests changes in something that's already been merged into `b0` then I guess I'd have to re-open, work on it, then merge it back in 🤔I'm not too sure really.",t2_4i904031,False,,0,False,How do you manage workflow with git branches for an analysis project?

Then I'm using k-medoids to clusterize.

&lt;p&gt;Then I&amp;#39;m using k-medoids to clusterize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now if I read the medoids that result from k-medoids, then take the rows of the medoids from the dissimilarity matrix, and finally sum the cluster labels from that corresponding medoid in that row , what do I  obtain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total sum of the dissimilarity of that cluster?&lt;/p&gt;

,datascience,"Hi data science reddit. My family is torn up fighting over my brothers recent career decision and I need your advice.

My brother is 30 years old. He is an oil &amp; gas reservoir engineer with 5 years experience working at Royal Dutch Shell. He’s about to lose his job because his sector/industry has been hit hard by COVID19 and as a result his company is going through a massive wave of layoffs.

For as long as I can remember he has been infatuated with computer science/ coding, and it’s always been a regret of his that he did not pursue this career path when he was younger. He doesn’t have any formal training or experience in this, although he is somewhat of an amateur coder (self-taught in python and some stuff like that) but I really have no clue how good he is at this stuff.

This lay-off has got him thinking about a career shift. His plan is to enroll in a 3 year undergrad computer science program and get a bachelors degree so he can become a data scientist.

My mom doesn’t support his decision to go back to school and they won’t stop fighting about it. I’m trying keep the peace between them and stay neutral, but I’m leaning more towards my mom’s POV. The idea of going back to school and starting his career from scratch as a 34 year old fresh grad looking for entry level work in data science seems radical to me, at the very least questionable. Am I wrong? Is this a good idea?

I suggested as an alternative that he enroll in a 2 year master’s program instead. I don’t know if this is a good idea either TBH but at least it would be 1 less year and it seems more practical to me that he pursue an advanced degree and possibly compete for more senior positions, given his age. But he seems to think that even if he earned a masters degree he still lacks the work experience to compete at a more senior level, so might as well get the bachelors degree. He also says that he wants to get a full education in computer science starting with the fundamentals, which he would not get from a masters program.

1. Is it too late for my brother to become a data scientist? (I know it’s never too late for anything and I’d love for my brother to follow his dream and all that, but if we’re being practical about this- is it too late?)

2. If not, what is the best way for my brother to break into this industry?

I'm in over my head doing stuff I haven't studied for writing about a subject that is wayyy off track from my masters. But I'm committed now since I find it interesting.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I'll try to keep in short. I found [this](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327298996_Hardcore_Gamer_Profiling_Results_from_an_unsupervised_learning_approach_to_playing_behavior_on_the_Steam_platform) paper and want to replicate what they did but instead of using k-means I want to use DBSCAN. The data is retrieved from the Steam platform and they aim to cluster players on their behaviour, i.e. how likely is it for someone that only plays AAA games to also play Indie or F2P games.    
&amp;nbsp;  
 [This](https://imgur.com/a/uRUCmQY) is the dataset that I'm working with and what I presume they used in the paper as well. For now I'm only trying to find out if using DBSCAN, with best practice parameters, will give me the same clusters as they got.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Things I'm currently having trouble with:  
&amp;nbsp;  
1) How should I imagine multidimensional clustering to take place? Like, I can, in my mind, visualize how clustering works on up to three axis but anything more than that I don't get. This gives me a bit of trouble because I want to make sense of the features that are chosen for the clustering. Is this even something I'm supposed to get?  
&amp;nbsp;  
2) Does the 'appid' feature in my dataset make sense to use in clustering? Something about the numbers feels off as they're not all the same length but my understanding is not good enough to pinpoint what exactly my problem with it is.  
&amp;nbsp;   
3) I tried using DBSCAN but apparently it is not optimized for large datasets, instead I used HDBSCAN which, after running for twelve hours finally gave me a result. Has anyone worked with HDBSCAN in combination with a dataset the size of mine and can give me some pointers on how to set my parameters?

,datascience,"Hi all, I'm not a data scientist but trying to create topics for open-ended comments we collect on a weekly survey (the exact question is : why is this your favorite brand?). I don't think it's a problem with my code as topics are indeed generated, they just don't make **any** sense. Keywords are represented in multiple topics. I even tried using bigrams/trigrams - creating ngrams of the default text without removing stopwords or lemmatizing creates topics that are just as useless, but if I do remove words then I have ngrams that are not accurate because those words don't actually appear together.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I've asked my team to hand code the topics, but I need a more sustainable way going forward. Is there a better way to generate distinct topics?  Or should I just focus on categorizing going forward based on what the team comes up with this time?

I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a problem with my code as topics are indeed generated, they just don&amp;#39;t make &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; sense. Keywords are represented in multiple topics. I even tried using bigrams/trigrams - creating ngrams of the default text without removing stopwords or lemmatizing creates topics that are just as useless, but if I do remove words then I have ngrams that are not accurate because those words don&amp;#39;t actually appear together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I&amp;#39;ve asked my team to hand code the topics, but I need a more sustainable way going forward. Is there a better way to generate distinct topics?  Or should I just focus on categorizing going forward based on what the team comes up with this time?&lt;/p&gt;

,datascience,"Hi guys!

This might be a long post, so thank you for taking the time to read this :)

I just graduated with a Sociology degree from a college in U.S, but discovered the field of data science in my senior year. I know a lot of people have told me that I might not need to go back to school, I can learn on my own to get a data science job with SQL, Python, but because I am from South East Asia (data science jobs are not very big here), I am hoping to go to college again to get a degree to be able to get a job abroad to work in the future. It's much easier to get a job abroad/work visa in e.g Canada, Australia etc if I graduate from there. I am wondering if anyone can give me any advice on countries/universities that would offer a second bachelors, masters or diploma that would allow me to learn more? I am hoping to avoid the U.S. because the work visa is a bit difficult to obtain.

I have been stuck on trying to find schools and been quite stressed about it... The amount of money that I can afford to spend on the whole degree (including accommodation, fees, tuition etc) is USD $60k-65k... since I have already spent a fortune on my current undergrad...

,datascience,"Hi all,

I would like to ask for advice on how to use recommendation letter from my post graduate professor. A few months ago I graduated from my master program of computer/data science from my university and I am looking for a job in the data science field. In the last semester, I have the privilege to work with the professors from the school's computer science department and are publishing a paper to ICML this year. The professor seems happy about my work and agree to write an recommendation letter for me, he even said he was willing to have one of his colleagues who is famous in the field to sign on the recommendation letter. So I start thinking what the best way to utilize this opportunity is to help on my current job search. 

There are two options that I can think of right now as below:

* Ask the professor to write the recommendation letter on my LinkedIn profile

The benefit of this option is that the letter can be viewed publicly by recruiters and HR managers and the value of the letter can be re-used and last long. However, I will not get the endorsement from my professor's famous colleague.

* Ask the professor to write the recommendation letter to a specific company that I apply for

In this solution, I will be able to get the signature from my professor and the famous person's name on the letter which increase the letter's value, but I can only use it once. If I didn't admitted to the company, the letter basically goes useless.

I am relatively inexperienced on this recommendation letter subject and open to any suggestion and advice, if you see any other better way to utilize the professor's recommendation letter, feel free to let me know.

I'd really appreciate.

tldr: My team's codebase is a mess of unorganized and poorly documented jupyter notebooks/.py files and I am trying to figure out the best method/way of managing all of it in a more standardized way.

As the title states, how do you all manage your company/team's codebase/tools? I recently got hired in a healthcare company as a statistical modeling analyst and to say the least - their unorganized as hell when it comes to their code. In the past, the position I have was handled by one person and basically just held all their code/juptyer notebooks in their personal directory; I am talking about \~2.5 years worth of ad hoc analysis, analytic tools (finished and unfinished), jupyter notebooks that outline several major processes. There are also some major production tools he made that are stored in his folder without any real meaningful way of doing some version control.

Then about 8 months ago, they hired my co-worker (lets call him Bob) who didn't have any coding background and learned by just re-using the first guy's work. He accessed/still accesses it through the first guy's folder, but copied it over to his own personal folder and added a bunch of edits. Well, the first guy leaves to Google and he leaves this mess without much documentation (I am talking even without much comments within the notebooks, let alone a README file).

Fast-forward to a month ago, I come in and am shadowing Bob and he is jumping back and forth across multiple (read: almost a dozen) different folders at a time trying to find the right jupyter notebook to use, has at least 5 untitled jupyter notebooks opened at once doing several things (sometimes working on the same project across multiple notebooks), and overall just a very messy and poorly documented workflow. Outputs get put in not a standardized fashion, everything just seems like a mess. He even confuses himself sometimes on which notebook is working on what.

I myself am starting to build tools/automate parts of the job, but I don't want to fall in the same habit of just storing it all on my personal directory and have files (.py) floating around everywhere. Luckily this position gives me a lot of freedom to spend time improving on this aspect of the job. So to return back to the original reason for the post - what is the best way to go about this? Should I try pushing for a github for our team in order to organize everything? Or is there a better alternative?

,datascience,"Hi, amateur data scientist here, and I've been tasked with building an automated categorization tool for supplier lists. In essence, it needs to take a vendor name, and output what category it falls into. Categories include, but are not limited too: Transportation, Legal, IT, Construction, Staffing, Manufacturing, or Maintenance &amp; Installation.

So far, I've considered two strategies.

* *Option A*
Using a google search API to scrape the top ten search results for that vendor, build or utilize an existing NLP algorithm to match the Google output with a category from a pre-built table of categories. 

* *Option B*
Build a table of supplier names and their associated categories using previous data, and then fuzzy match new supplier data as best I can with the pre-built table. This one is tricky as ""Delta Air Inc,"" ""D Airlines,"" ""Delta"" would all need to be matched to the same supplier, but not ""D Air""--that's an air conditioning company. Additionally, it would be added too as needed---if the supplier isn't present, either manually input their data or utilize something like *Option A*. 

Looking over the two options, I see now that they may be one and the same, but two different levels in the hierarchy of the tool.

,datascience,"Hoping to tap the hivemind of Reddit for this question.

For those of you who manage data science managers/people leaders, or are part of interview panels for data science managers: are there different expectations of technical aptitude between people manager candidates and ICs who apply for \[senior/principal\] data science roles?

Why I'm asking this question: I'm a people manager myself at a mid-sized company in the Bay Area, with a Masters in Data Science and 4+ years of leadership experience (in industry for 15). I am simply not as ""in the weeds"" as my team members are... nor is there an expectation by my leadership teams that I code or query every day; while this frustrates me, I continue to receive praise for helping my team do better work, asking the right questions, ensuring they are staying on track, etc. 

However, I have applied to other manager positions, and my technical interviews have been VERY technical: I've had a total of 10-15 technical-round interviews in the last 6-8 months. It's clear that I pass the leadership scrutiny test, but I continue to miss expectations on the technical front. In short, I'm rusty. 

I understand that teams and companies have different needs... but are companies really expecting senior managers and/or directors to be able to perform technically at the same level as ICs? Or is the truth of the matter that I--and others in my situation--simply have to review like crazy, even at this level? Are VPs asked technical questions as well?

&lt;p&gt;Hope that wasn&amp;#39;t too rant-like. Would love to hear thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

,datascience,"I've taken schooling for this my entire life to be honest. It's always been mathematical and statistical, and in my second bout of education, focused more on computing to apply this math.

But for data scientists we have to know so much spanning different fields. **From math, statistics, to optimization, to data structures, and algorithms, to your specific programming language gotchas, more advanced statistical + computing algorithms including ML/DL/ etc...**

How can someone possibly remember all of this and retain all the different sources of knowledge in memory? It's not like I have not been taught this and didn't know the specifics before. But it's never efficiently stored in memory. For some very common basics, I have to look up and remember how they work again.

1. So take linear regression for example something I've studied multiple times before. It's the most basic. I can right now tell you the general formula of the equation, and what it's trying to do. But if someone were to ask me right now to explain the internals of gradient descent (DESPITE taking multiple courses that taught/used this concept), I wouldn't be able to tell you. I can tell you the gist, and I have some visualization of my mind of the process, in that it's essentially trying to look for the direction of highest negative change.  For logistic regression, I can tell you its for classification and that it uses MLE to solve, but would have to look up again the implementation. For example, I don't remember how MLE works but know its related to probability.
2. If someone were to then ask me to explain something that involves more computing and computer science. So say something about bytes, binary representation, how it's used. I can give you the general gist that it's used to represent/store data in an efficient manner. But that's it. I can't give you more specifics to that, and would probably have to learn it all again with more details.
3. With data structures/algorithms, despite learning it before, I can give you a general gist of what they involve, but that's it. For example, a dictionary is cool because it allows easy key lookup because it uses hash representation. A list is ordered and is iterable, etc... I understand the general concept of time complexity but probably will struggle if asked to figure out whether something represents exponential time. Just the other day, had to refresh on the differences between hashable and mutable, etc...

My point is, there's just so many different fields we have to have working knowledge on. And don't even get me started with more http, web servers, etc...  It's something I haven't been taught and haven't had the chance to learn yet as I'm still trying to remember, learn, maintain everything else. How do people REMEMBER all of this?

,datascience,"I have slightly over 12 years of experience, pretty much all of it in the tech industry. I started as a Business Analyst 12+ years ago in a startup based out of the midwestern USA right after undergrad degree in Engineering. Data Scientist as a title didn't exist back then, but I still did a bunch of statistical modeling in SAS. 

Later, moved to the tech division of a Fortune 50 company in the Bay Area, again as a BA. Then moved to a FAANG company as a DS, which opened the door for other FAANGs, so I spent time in two more FAANGs in various roles before moving to a bay area unicorn. In this time I also finished a masters in my employer's dime.

Had promotions in every company I worked in, except for one in the middle because of my tenure being too short. Here are some tips to aspiring and current data scientists.

1. **Getting hired:** I'll admit, I got ridiculously lucky. I don't think the 21 year old me would get hired at a tech company right now. I didn't have a portfolio, no experience in DS/Analytics/Statistical Modeling, and no family connections in the industry. A friend who was a year ahead of me in college was already working for the startup as an Engineer and since he knew I was ""mathematically gifted"" (his words, not mine), he got me the job. I learned everything on the job from SQL, SAS (yes, I'm that old), and even Excel. However, with DS and ML becoming the new gold rush, companies, especially tech companies, doubly so for FAANGs are spoiled for choice. So it's important to stand out. I've done a lot of hiring for FAANGs, so I feel like I can pass on some advice. As with anything on the internet, please take this with a grain of salt because this is only based on my experience, and isn't meant to be universal. For folks who're fresh out of school/still in school - internships help a lot. But in the absence of industry experience, the thing I look for is your ability to solve open ended problems using DS/ML. Kaggle competitions like predicting the survivors of Titanic have been done a million times over and don't show anything that I haven't already seen. So pick a problem in a domain that you think is interesting and do something DS related, like building a cool Data Viz, or building a model to predict/explain something, etc. For the more experienced folks, highlight the impact of your previous work. This leads neatly into my second point.

2. **Impact not method:** Unless you’re working in the research arm of tech companies (MSR, Google Brain, FAIR), or in Academia, your boss’s boss likely doesn’t care about what method you used to solve the problem. Just what the impact to the company was. So stop focusing on methodology and start focusing on how you’re helping the business. Remember that you’ve not been hired to write SQL and Python, you’ve been hired to help do one of: (a) make more money for the company, (b) cut costs for the company - which also includes helping others in the company be more effective by building internal tools. However, it’s relatively unheard of to have an entry level DS being given an open ended problem and being asked to solve it, you will likely have to rely on your manager and/mentors to do that for you. But over time, the expectation is for you to become more and more independent. Which would require you to constantly learn new things and adapt to change. Keep in mind that this doesn't mean you should stop paying attention to using the right methodology for the right problem, but that when you're telling your story, focus on the impact.

3. **Getting promoted:** Unless you’re exceptionally talented or exceptionally lucky, promotions won’t happen without asking for it. Have open and honest conversations with your manager about the expectations for the next level and chart a course to get there. Ask for feedback and continuously improve. As you grow in your career, especially past the *Senior* level, your ability to influence your peers, and leaders matters a lot more than your technical competency. So identify areas where you can exercise that muscle. It’s very different muscle from being a technically capable data scientist. A mistake I see a lot of young Data Scientists making is relying on the idea that more work will get you promoted. It won’t, at least after a point. What it takes to go from L3 (entry level) DS to L4 (the very next level) is very different from what it takes to get to L5 (Senior) and above. 

4. **When moving companies, know the levels:** I got seriously burnt in my last role. I misunderstood their leveling system and took a role at a level below my expected level, became seriously resentful at seeing people with half my experience being in the level above me, eventually ended up leaving because I thought it was a clear case of bait and switch. So do your research, talk to people in the company if you can. levels.fyi is a great resource to understand level equivalence across companies.

5. **Find a mentor, then mentor others:** If your company has many Data Scientists, find someone who you look up to and ask them to be your mentor. Go prepared to your mentorship sessions, ask pointed questions and ask for their advice. More importantly follow-up with them and show how their advice helped you. Once you're comfortable enough, pass on the favor to those who come after you. If you're the only DS in a company - which I've seen cases of, find industry mentors. I've seen many forums for you to find DS mentors. If nothing works, reach out to people in the industry on LinkedIn asking for mentorship. More than half the time, they will accept.

6. **Strike a balance between technical skills and soft skills:** As I mentioned above, the further you get in your career, the less important your technical ability becomes. That doesn’t mean you can afford not to know the basics, it just means you’re valued more for your ability to influence your peers, stakeholders, and leaders than your ability to write beautiful code. So learning after a point has to span both the (almost orthogonal) axes of technical ability and soft skills. You cannot afford to be lax on learning new techniques because the world around us is changing. I started my job knowing only SQL and SAS. Then my toolkit was SQL, SAS and R. I only picked up Python ~2-3 years ago. I’m sure it’s not gonna end here. Learning is a lifelong endeavor in a field like this. At the same time, I was also learning to be a better negotiator, and a better leader. 

7. **Focus on quality of life:** Remember that I have had over 12 years to do this, and I’m not even half-way into my career. Careers span 30+ years. Learn to take a breather, take vacations, take breaks and disconnect from it all once in a while. An endless rat-race will leave you burned out and unable to focus. It happened to me 5-6 years into my career where I felt overwhelmed everyday. It’s not good for you in the long run. I know this point sounds contradictory to everything I’ve said above about constantly having to learn, but it really isn’t if you put it into a 30+ year time-span. You don’t have to be the best analyst, best machine learning engineer, the best story teller, and the best leader in year 2. You can pick and choose what you want to learn based on your environment and what’s needed immediately.

8. **Don’t gatekeep, don’t look down on others, help those who ask:** Nothing bothers me more than seeing young Data Scientists/ML Engineers looking down on Data Analysts, calling them SQL monkeys. A lot of them also look down on people who do sales and marketing. Remember, even in companies like FAANG, your ability to get paid ultimately depends on the marketing and sales people’s ability to sell the things you build. Work with everyone, help anyone who will ask, and be nice to everyone you come across. Being known as the person who is “nice to work with” will take you much farther than being a 10x engineer (a term I’ve come to loathe).

I started as a Business Analyst 12+ years ago in a startup based out of the midwestern USA right after undergrad degree in Engineering. Data Scientist as a title didn&amp;#39;t exist back then, but I still did a bunch of statistical modeling in SAS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, moved to the tech division of a Fortune 50 company in the Bay Area, again as a BA. Then moved to a FAANG company as a DS, which opened the door for other FAANGs, so I spent time in two more FAANGs in various roles before moving to a bay area unicorn. In this time I also finished a masters in my employer&amp;#39;s dime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had promotions in every company I worked in, except for one in the middle because of my tenure being too short. Here are some tips to aspiring and current data scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting hired:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ll admit, I got ridiculously lucky. I don&amp;#39;t think the 21 year old me would get hired at a tech company right now. I didn&amp;#39;t have a portfolio, no experience in DS/Analytics/Statistical Modeling, and no family connections in the industry. A friend who was a year ahead of me in college was already working for the startup as an Engineer and since he knew I was &amp;quot;mathematically gifted&amp;quot; (his words, not mine), he got me the job. I learned everything on the job from SQL, SAS (yes, I&amp;#39;m that old), and even Excel. However, with DS and ML becoming the new gold rush, companies, especially tech companies, doubly so for FAANGs are spoiled for choice. So it&amp;#39;s important to stand out. I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of hiring for FAANGs, so I feel like I can pass on some advice. As with anything on the internet, please take this with a grain of salt because this is only based on my experience, and isn&amp;#39;t meant to be universal. For folks who&amp;#39;re fresh out of school/still in school - internships help a lot. But in the absence of industry experience, the thing I look for is your ability to solve open ended problems using DS/ML. Kaggle competitions like predicting the survivors of Titanic have been done a million times over and don&amp;#39;t show anything that I haven&amp;#39;t already seen. So pick a problem in a domain that you think is interesting and do something DS related, like building a cool Data Viz, or building a model to predict/explain something, etc. For the more experienced folks, highlight the impact of your previous work. This leads neatly into my second point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact not method:&lt;/strong&gt; Unless you’re working in the research arm of tech companies (MSR, Google Brain, FAIR), or in Academia, your boss’s boss likely doesn’t care about what method you used to solve the problem. Just what the impact to the company was. So stop focusing on methodology and start focusing on how you’re helping the business. Remember that you’ve not been hired to write SQL and Python, you’ve been hired to help do one of: (a) make more money for the company, (b) cut costs for the company - which also includes helping others in the company be more effective by building internal tools. However, it’s relatively unheard of to have an entry level DS being given an open ended problem and being asked to solve it, you will likely have to rely on your manager and/mentors to do that for you. But over time, the expectation is for you to become more and more independent. Which would require you to constantly learn new things and adapt to change. Keep in mind that this doesn&amp;#39;t mean you should stop paying attention to using the right methodology for the right problem, but that when you&amp;#39;re telling your story, focus on the impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting promoted:&lt;/strong&gt; Unless you’re exceptionally talented or exceptionally lucky, promotions won’t happen without asking for it. Have open and honest conversations with your manager about the expectations for the next level and chart a course to get there. Ask for feedback and continuously improve. As you grow in your career, especially past the &lt;em&gt;Senior&lt;/em&gt; level, your ability to influence your peers, and leaders matters a lot more than your technical competency. So identify areas where you can exercise that muscle. It’s very different muscle from being a technically capable data scientist. A mistake I see a lot of young Data Scientists making is relying on the idea that more work will get you promoted. It won’t, at least after a point. What it takes to go from L3 (entry level) DS to L4 (the very next level) is very different from what it takes to get to L5 (Senior) and above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When moving companies, know the levels:&lt;/strong&gt; I got seriously burnt in my last role. I misunderstood their leveling system and took a role at a level below my expected level, became seriously resentful at seeing people with half my experience being in the level above me, eventually ended up leaving because I thought it was a clear case of bait and switch. So do your research, talk to people in the company if you can. levels.fyi is a great resource to understand level equivalence across companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find a mentor, then mentor others:&lt;/strong&gt; If your company has many Data Scientists, find someone who you look up to and ask them to be your mentor. Go prepared to your mentorship sessions, ask pointed questions and ask for their advice. More importantly follow-up with them and show how their advice helped you. Once you&amp;#39;re comfortable enough, pass on the favor to those who come after you. If you&amp;#39;re the only DS in a company - which I&amp;#39;ve seen cases of, find industry mentors. I&amp;#39;ve seen many forums for you to find DS mentors. If nothing works, reach out to people in the industry on LinkedIn asking for mentorship. More than half the time, they will accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strike a balance between technical skills and soft skills:&lt;/strong&gt; As I mentioned above, the further you get in your career, the less important your technical ability becomes. That doesn’t mean you can afford not to know the basics, it just means you’re valued more for your ability to influence your peers, stakeholders, and leaders than your ability to write beautiful code. So learning after a point has to span both the (almost orthogonal) axes of technical ability and soft skills. You cannot afford to be lax on learning new techniques because the world around us is changing. I started my job knowing only SQL and SAS. Then my toolkit was SQL, SAS and R. I only picked up Python ~2-3 years ago. I’m sure it’s not gonna end here. Learning is a lifelong endeavor in a field like this. At the same time, I was also learning to be a better negotiator, and a better leader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on quality of life:&lt;/strong&gt; Remember that I have had over 12 years to do this, and I’m not even half-way into my career. Careers span 30+ years. Learn to take a breather, take vacations, take breaks and disconnect from it all once in a while. An endless rat-race will leave you burned out and unable to focus. It happened to me 5-6 years into my career where I felt overwhelmed everyday. It’s not good for you in the long run. I know this point sounds contradictory to everything I’ve said above about constantly having to learn, but it really isn’t if you put it into a 30+ year time-span. You don’t have to be the best analyst, best machine learning engineer, the best story teller, and the best leader in year 2. You can pick and choose what you want to learn based on your environment and what’s needed immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t gatekeep, don’t look down on others, help those who ask:&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing bothers me more than seeing young Data Scientists/ML Engineers looking down on Data Analysts, calling them SQL monkeys. A lot of them also look down on people who do sales and marketing. Remember, even in companies like FAANG, your ability to get paid ultimately depends on the marketing and sales people’s ability to sell the things you build. Work with everyone, help anyone who will ask, and be nice to everyone you come across. Being known as the person who is “nice to work with” will take you much farther than being a 10x engineer (a term I’ve come to loathe).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

,datascience,"Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

About 4 years ago I took a career sidestep from an oil/gas science role to data science (with a data analyst stepping stone in the middle). I am now a senior data scientist with a mid-sized medical technology company in their R&amp;D division.

&amp;#x200B;

However, there are five slightly concerning issues with my current role/situation:

1) I am the only formally titled 'Data Scientist' in the company. (There are other's who easily have the knowledge and experience to be one but are put under the 'Stats' umbrella)

2) The company's DS capabilities are very much in their infancy. (But one of their key focuses is to change that)

3) It is the kind of company that doesn't seem to know what a data scientist does. (Although, thankfully, they have given me a huge amount of flexibility and autonomy to get things done)

4) The term 'Senior' in this company appears to be scaled differently to other companies I've been in. (I think everyone who has come in so far has at least a 'senior' role!)

5) I never had any formal data science learning/training and most of what I've learned has been on the job or what I'm picking up from ESL and PRML. (I come from a Maths/Natural Sciences background so I like to think I have the mind to pick DS/ML concepts up quickly)

&amp;#x200B;

So far my role has been more of a data engineering one and I've spent the past year consolidating the company's data, getting teams to move away from storing data in spreadsheets, and coordinating with the IT department to set up a data warehouse which has, so far, been very successful. I'm now in a position to start analysing data and building models to help the business. (Although I'm a little concerned about my lack in breath of knowledge of DS/ML)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really enjoying the job and I have no plans to leave but I always like to have an escape route and I worry that I've managed to oversell myself into a senior DS role. I feel like I'm under-qualified to transition into another senior DS role (should anything happen to my role or the company) and that my current DE work has taken time away from my development.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is expected of a senior data scientist and what should I be focusing my development on for now? Should I be expanding my knowledgebase of modelling techniques? Or managerial skills? Or something else?

,datascience,"Hello fellows!
I'm an undergrad experimenting with ML in Timeseries predictions right now. I collected data of tomatoes yielded per day in our home kitchen garden over 83 days, and decided to try and forecast it.

I used a simple linear regression model, feeding in 5 values as features and the next value as a the label. Please see the result [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18niGw7SnZ3QI2npQ7QMfFbDpH9rh7SPk/view?usp=drivesdk). The vertical red line at 60 is the training/testing split value. 

I have a few questions regarding this:
1)  Why does it seem that my predicted curve is leading the original data by roughly 5 time steps (same as my window size)?

2) What else should I try to achieve better results?

,datascience,"Hi everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to do a project but I'm not sure if it's really viable neither which path I should take to try and solve this.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a dataset with numerous incidents from different places and their risk classification. For example:

&gt;Incident: ""John stumbled and fell down the stairs""  
&gt;  
&gt;Risk: Severe  
&gt;  
&gt;Warehouse: A  
&gt;  
&gt;Date: 2020-07-11  
&gt;  
&gt;\---  
&gt;  
&gt;Incident: ""Mary left the door open""  
&gt;  
&gt;Risk: Low  
&gt;  
&gt;Warehouse: B  
&gt;  
&gt;Date: 2020-07-10 

&amp;#x200B;

My idea is to compile the incidents by warehouse by week and give a probability of incidents happening in each warehouse for every risk.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Warehouse A  
&gt;  
&gt;Probability of low risk incidents next week: 60%  
&gt;  
&gt;Probability of severe risk incidents next week: 30%

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm not really sure how to get around this problem. It's not really text classification because I know the classification of every report (risk). Is there a way to use this dataset and get any prediction for the next week?

# Job Purpose

There has been identified a lack of clear data structure and process within the organisation and confirmation that data needs to be managed, retained, analysed and stored with greater control and routine. The role of the Data &amp; Analytics Lead would be to:

* To define, own and implement a group-wide data strategy and ensure the strategic vision for data architecture is met and maintained by working with the CEO (in line with their 3-year strategic vision) and a range of Stakeholders including Department Heads, Managers and Support Workers.
* To develop and promote a central database architecture that aids the organisation in achieving its strategic goals
* Work with various teams throughout the organisation to provide analysis and valuable insights to unlock opportunities, drive data-informed business decisions and to make a positive impact on our service users.

# Key Objectives/Responsibilities

**Infrastructure**

* Partner with leadership and peers to understand report requirements, map and document existing business processes, evaluating output requirements and formats and ensure consistency across teams
* Implement and administer the large CRM database initiative and provide database user support.

&amp;#x200B;

**Analysis**

* Effectively use data to tell stories, communicate key insights through internal reports, presentations and dashboards to drive business decisions.
* Define and share key business performance indicators with the leadership team.
* Analysis of our customer and donor base to help our retail and fundraising teams understand our supporters.
* Help get the most out of our website, content and social platforms - by understanding and helping in the optimization of customer journeys and marketing/advertising campaign performance

&amp;#x200B;

**Management**

* Help to drive the data strategy group-wide.
* Work with the with leadership &amp; management teams across the group to understand their requirements &amp; data sources, set priorities based on analysis and results to implement and optimise fundraising, impact and commercial processes and solutions
* Work with the leadership teams to build dashboards and KPI monitoring reports for providing insights to enable better planning and performance monitoring across the organisation.
* Work closely with various teams within the organisation to gain a holistic view of customers, trends and competitors

\----

I appreciate that this may be asking a lot from one person, especially on a low/mid-range salary but it is what we need and all we can afford. I'm hoping that it will be a great working experience for the person taking the role who will see it as an opportunity to develop their role and get their feet wet in a senior data position. With that, there will also be patience and expectation for a lot of on the job learning, that this will be a long process and the person filling the role won't magically be able to implement/fix everything listed above within their first year in the role. We see this as a two-year+ journey to data maturity.

,datascience,"Matt Tran, the owner of Engineered Truth on youtube, nowadays is working with a Congo dude to promote data science courses. He had multiple videos saying that even a bachelor's degree is not required to get a job as a data scientist since you can self learn online. He even went as far as saying that CS and Math degrees are worthless and you should just go to a data science Bootcamp to get a job as a data scientist, and now he is promoting his courses. 

Btw, this is the guy who threatened and blackmailed a college kid for criticizing him, so you know what kind of person he is. His videos seem to target audiences who are living in 3rd world countries. His courses cost 350 dollars and claiming that this is better than the MIT professor's course.

,datascience,"Hey all, i have a general ML/DS question.  

Despite me being in school for CS and minoring in stats with a handful of machine learning, math, and statistics courses under my belt, i currently lack the ability to ""think like a data scientist"" (diagnosis upon my own observations...). How does one get there? Of course it doesnt happen over night but is there a general guideline on how to get there or advice on what one should do? Feeling really stuck these days...

I'm currently working as a Data Scientist Coop but can really see my flaws and areas that i need improvement. I feel as though my mindset and toolset right now as a ""data scientist"" is more like...script kitty/plug in and play...very narrow minded.

,datascience,"Hi all,

So for work I analyze course survey data for professors looking to potentially redesign their courses and take them from an in-person lecture based class to a fully online self-regulated learning based class. So I'm the person who is doing all the data wrangling and am doing it in R. This is my first time ever having a job or doing something like this for such a scale. Everybody else uses SPSS but I don't know how to use SPSS and I use my personal Mac for work and SPSS just does not want to work on my Mac. Besides, R is better (but I'm the only person on my team of people that knows how to use it) .... Anyways,

Right now we have a project where we are analyzing Fall 2018, Spring 2019, Fall 2019, and Spring 2020 course survey data (labeled FA18, SP19, FA19, and SP20 respectively) for four classes: a math class (MA 101), a business class (BUS 563), a computer science class (CSC 362), and a biochemistry class (BCH 231).

Within each semester, there are three surveys administered to the class uniformly across the semester-- one at the beginning (BGN), the middle (called MID), and the end (END -- really creative I know). We call these time points ""phases"". So now, for each of the four classes, I have a grand total of 12 surveys (4 semesters worth of data x 3 surveys administered total).

Let's talk about the surveys. I wish I could say each survey asks the exact same questions, but they don't. Stuff that exists in one of the MA 101 surveys might not exist in say, the BCH 231 survey and even for one particular course there are some questions that are only asked at a certain phase. This is to be expected though, however, I have a few tasks:

1. Download these course survey results (whether it's the BGN survey, MID survey, or END survey) from Qualtrics in SPSS, then bring the SPSS data into R (my boss just sends me the SPSS data hence why I worded it this way. I don't have access to Qualtrics and I don't use SPSS on my Mac since it acts all wonky). To bring in SPSS data I use the haven package which works fantastically :)
2. Clean this data. There are a lot of variables here, but these variables are literally questions with pre-defined labels. A common question we ask in any of these surveys is ""describe your interest in this subject matter before, during, or after \[depending on the phase\] of this course."" This question we just call ""Interest1"" or something. Things like that (if that makes any sense). So part of the data cleaning process involves me using the reshape package to go in and manually go through every single variable and either rename it or tell R to exclude it from the final data set. This is a very time consuming and tedious process might I add. The variables that come to mind are things like ""StudentIDNum"", ""ResponseID"", ""First Name"", ""Last Name"", ""Email Address"", ""Year in School"", ""Interest1"", etc. I also have to change missing values from -99 to N/A for each of these variables in all of this data. If someone could be as so kind to tell me how to do this that would be so wonderful :) This data is also mostly all Likert Scale data. So a lot of my data is just columns of integers between 1 and 5. Not all of it is though, but I would like it to be. Some of my data is like ""Definitely no"", ""sometimes no"", ""maybe"", ""sometimes yes"", and ""yes"". Know what I mean? I would also love to know how to convert variables with responses like this to integers between 1 and 5 please and thank you :)
3. Now once I have cleaned all my data and spit out a cleaned CSV file for each of the surveys administered for the students to take (which, might I add, don't always all have a 100% response rate -- again, to be expected though), my task is to then merge each of the three survey results into one combined data set for a given semester. From here, then I take each of these merged data sets for one semester, and put them all together so that way for a particular course, say MA 101, we have one massive combined data set that consists of a bunch of survey results across time: FA18\_BGN FA18\_MID FA18\_END SP19\_BGN SP19\_MID SP19\_END ... SP20\_BGN SP20\_MID SP20\_END. Something like that, does that make sense?
4. Now once I have one massive merged/combined data set for each of these four courses, then ultimately I have to merge all of these data sets into one super massive combined data set.

So ultimately my question is how do I do this? Do I just use the merge() function in R? This function can only take two data sets at a time though and also within this function there is the ""by ="" parameter which, to my best understanding, tells R by what variables do you want to merge by? I was doing by intersect(dataset 1, dataset 2) but apparently that's not what my boss wants. He wants literally all of it merged together whether someone responded to all three surveys in a given course or only did just one. And also because there isn't really likely an overlap between students across semesters for a given course or any of the other classes (save maybe for the MA 101 course and the CSC 362 course), how do I handle merging this? Should I tell my boss that what he wants isn't feasible?

I apologize for asking so many questions and sounding like a confused idiot, but well, that's exactly what I am. This is my first big boy stats job because I'm in grad school for statistics so I'm brand spanking new to it (background is pure math -- undergrad and masters in it) and just finished my first year. I've never really had to clean data sets before or do any of that kind of work and I'm working with some education and psychology researchers and people this summer which is why they all use SPSS. Because we have a work from home order though I'm using my Mac to do all my work on and I'm actually using my brand new one I just got. The MacBook Pro I was previously using (and had been using for the past 6 years) died about 4 weeks ago and since all the apple stores are closed between my summer courses and work I had to get a new one. I tried a work one for a bit but I couldn't download anything (R/R Studio) and I needed a new personal one anyways so I got this one. My old one had a trial of SPSS on it though and Jesus did that thing never want to freaking work. It always froze on me and made everything so slow. Plus I want to refine my R skills and get good at it (mostly I've just been using SAS this whole first year -- ew, but, well, apparently our school likes to use SAS for some reason idk).

But yeah, I don't know how to best join these data sets and account for the lack of complete responses, and I'm just feeling overwhelmed because nobody else on my team knows how to program in R well and I'm super new to all this statistics and data stuff so I'm just feeling super stressed about it all. This is why I'm turning to r/datascience to help. Thank you for taking the time to read all this and helping a poor grad student out! It really does mean a lot and I am very appreciative of your time.

I have been searching on Google for the answer but since I'm pretty new to handling this much data, I hope someone more experienced can give me some advice.

,datascience,"Hi,

I have passed this week the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate) from Google. I could not find a lot of feedback here about people taking it so I am writing this post hoping it will help people who want to take it. 

The exam contains 5 problems to solve, part of the code is already written and you need to complete it.  It can last up to 5 hours, you need to upload your ID/Passport and take a picture using your webcam at the beginning, but no one is going to monitor what you do during those 5 hours. You do not need to book your exam beforehand, you can just pay and start right away. There is no restriction on what you can access to during the exam.

I strongly recommend you to take [Coursera's TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice) as the questions in the exam are similar to the exercises you can find in this course. I had previous experience with TensorFlow but anyone with a decent knowledge of Deep Learning and finishes the specialization should be capable of taking the exam.

I would say the big drawback of this exam is the fact you need to take it in Pycharm on your own laptop. I suggest you do the exercises from the Specialization using Pycharm if you haven't used it before (I didn't and lost time in the exam trying to get basic stuff working in Pycharm). I don't have GPU on my laptop and also lost time while waiting for training to be done (never more than \~10mins each time but it adds up), so if you can get GPU go for it! In my opinion it would have make more sense to do the exam in Google Colab... 

Last advice: for multiple questions the source comes from [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets), spend some time understanding the structure of the objects you get as a result from load\_data , it was not clear for me (and not very well documented either!), that's time saved during the exam.

I would be happy to answer other questions if you have some!",t2_1tx9d060,False,,0,False,Passed TensorFlow Developer Certification,[],r/datascience,False,6,education,0,,,False,t3_gc29zj,False,dark,0.97,,public,403,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Education,False,403,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1588432418.0,text,6,,,text,self.datascience,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have passed this week the &lt;a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate""&gt;TensorFlow Developer Certificate&lt;/a&gt; from Google. I could not find a lot of feedback here about people taking it so I am writing this post hoping it will help people who want to take it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exam contains 5 problems to solve, part of the code is already written and you need to complete it.  It can last up to 5 hours, you need to upload your ID/Passport and take a picture using your webcam at the beginning, but no one is going to monitor what you do during those 5 hours. You do not need to book your exam beforehand, you can just pay and start right away. There is no restriction on what you can access to during the exam.&lt;/p&gt;
