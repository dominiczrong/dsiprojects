,SoftwareEngineering,"How do you build an open feedback culture like GitHub?

We had a chat with **Ryan Nystrom (Director of Engineering at Github)** about Github’s feedback culture. In this interview, Ryan shares some **insider stories, tips** on how can you build a similar feedback culture.

**I’m highlighting my favourite tips here:**

0. Before anything else, you have to know, even if you’re at a small company, you can’t start it early enough. You need to set up a feedback system with a regular cycle. 

1. Have everyone do self-reviews

Wherever you are, it can’t hurt to think about what you’ve been doing over the last months. A bit of self-reflection is a great first stage for your feedback system. 

2. You need peer reviews

In the next step have your employees write peer reviews for each other. You want at least 3-5 peer reviews for everyone, but it never hurts to have more. 

3. Send feedback through the manager

Ryan’s recommendation for smaller companies’ feedback cycles is to send peer reviews through the managers. They compile it, and discuss it with team members individually.

&lt;p&gt;In the next step have your employees write peer reviews for each other. You want at least 3-5 peer reviews for everyone, but it never hurts to have more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Send feedback through the manager&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan’s recommendation for smaller companies’ feedback cycles is to send peer reviews through the managers. They compile it, and discuss it with team members individually.&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask, but any help would be appreciated. 

So I’m currently going to a community college because I am on the fence about majors/degrees. My particular community college offers a few different CIS programs all resulting in associates degrees, and a few of them have listed software engineering as something you can get into with these degrees on the website. There is a university near me that I can go to instead, but I’m not sure which would be the best option because I am open to both. If I were fresh out of high school I would absolutely just jump towards going to the university, however I have been on a completely different degree track (nursing) since I’ve graduated hs, and I have already acquired student loans and would rather not add any more if I don’t need to.

I’ve been looking at indeed at different software engineering jobs in my area to get a feel of what is required, and many of them say they require a bachelors degree + experience (I am in the STL area but in IL).

So my question is, is it even worth it to get an associates degree in the subject? Or just go straight with the bachelors? Is it harder to get a job with an associates degree or does it just pay less? I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense, but really any help or advice would be awesome.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Did you know that people have been building scientific and technological innovations through testing and experimentation for centuries?

Roughly 2,000 years ago Eratosthenes measured the circumference of Earth.

Newton's prism experiment proved color is an inherent property of light itself.

Marie Curie, using an instrument called an electrometer, found that radioactivity is an inherent property of individual atoms that emanates from their internal structure.

All of these experiments paved the way for modern medicine, geography, energy, communication, physics, etc.

In today's technological world, experimentation holds the same power when it comes to innovation.

In fact, some of the biggest companies, like Amazon, Netflix, and Google, use this scientific method to challenge the status quo. In return, they innovate, grow, and improve.

**In this post, you'll find a few tips for how you can build a culture of experimentation at your company and continuously innovate.**

I attend a top tier university, but the job market for typical grads in my field has been affected and I'm unsure if I'll be able to procure employment. I'm honestly wishing I had chosen to study CS, as I love data analysis and problem-solving. I've taught myself some python so far, which I've enjoyed and taken onto nicely, and feel this realization has come too late.

My college major is Earth and Environmental Sciences. I've really enjoyed the coursework which has involved a lot of analyzing and interpreting data(only through excel, however). I feel the Bootcamp would be a nice fit to fill in my gaps in coding and programming literacy. I'm unsure of if I'll be able to procure a decent job straight after graduating(especially with the current situation), which would provide the perfect opportunity to do a boot camp. The lifestyle of a programmer/software engineer fits me very well, especially with the widespread possibilities for remote work.

,SoftwareEngineering,"I am building the initial set of unit tests for my team's legacy API client system. We have been writing integration tests, but have no unit tests.
It's a `Sinatra` server that accepts requests from our web app and contacts the third-party APIs. Sometimes it returns the result to the web app.

```
                                 1                     2

                                                        3
```

This being a legacy system, I am thinking about writing [characterization tests][1]. I will test the following:

1. mock our API Client class methods, to check how the input data to the server endpoints gets processed and formatted when it reaches our API Client class methods.
2. Similarly mock (or inject) the call to the 3rd party API, to check how the input data to API Client class method gets processed and formatted when it reaches the 3rd party API call.
3. Return canned server responses, to check how our program responds and processes each response.

Since the tests will be characterization tests, I will be just using the output generated by the code run by the test runner.

I am not sure how to generate inputs. The payloads are pretty complex objects, which can have ~30 fields (parameters) for some endpoints.

I don't think it is realistic to test all possible combinations of input parameters. Here's my plan:

- For each test, create a test input that's as typical as possible using the real payload. Save it in a file, as a fixture.
- Identify some fields that are interesting, important, or have previously caused errors. Create test cases for these fields. Load the fixture, and in each test case, overwrite a field in the payload with an extreme value, boundary value, or an illegal value, and making assertions with each payload. For example, if field A should be in range 5 &lt; A &lt; 15, with A = 5, A = 15, A = 4, A = 14, A = nil, etc.
- Run the test with failing expected values. Copy the actual output from the test runner, paste into expected values.

I am not sure if 1. this is the correct way to do characterization tests, and 2. this is a good way to create test input data. Am I overdoing it? Or doing it completely wrong?

For example, if field A should be in range 5 &amp;lt; A &amp;lt; 15, with A = 5, A = 15, A = 4, A = 14, A = nil, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the test with failing expected values. Copy the actual output from the test runner, paste into expected values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure if 1. this is the correct way to do characterization tests, and 2. this is a good way to create test input data. Am I overdoing it? Or doing it completely wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

The best I&amp;#39;ve been able to come up with is using Github&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Help Wanted&amp;quot; issues on open source projects and solving them with the interviewee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- it shows how candidates would work in a real world problem and coding exercise&lt;br/&gt;
- it gives back to the community&lt;br/&gt;
- added bonus of some free publicity for your company recruiting by fixing issues on a public platform&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"Is there a way to simply aggregate API docs from multiple sources (different microservices on different hosts) and show them in a single front-end, without having to inject a bunch of service registry nonsense into each individual app? Something like swagger-ui where you can select from a list of all configured services.

I imagine it as a kind of standalone API-docs server where you configure multiple sources, like
```
sources:
  app1: https://foo.host:8080/api/openapidocs
  app2: https://bar.host:8080/api/openapidocs
```

And then I can run the API doc portal without these services knowing or caring about it. FWIW the services are written in Java/Spring. We do provide the API specification in OAS 3.0 in the services already.

I realize this can be done with Spring Cloud, but it requires a bunch of service registry stuff like Eureka etc that we don't want to bloat or environment with.

,SoftwareEngineering,"So this was a kind of a thought experiment for fun. 

This post is a bit tongue in cheek but the result was cute and it was fun. Nothing here to be taken seriously. 

tldr: made a tiny blogging thing for the terminal using bash scripts because bored and fun. 

I read a blog post about the problem of website bloat. The blog post itself came in at a fairly heft weight already, irony, and it got me thinking about what the smallest and lightweight blogging platform I could “invent” in an afternoon was. Here was the catch though, I didn’t just want to go light on bandwidth I wanted to go light on system resources too; so the browser had to go. 

Here was the “brief” in general:

1. As light on system resources as possible (no to browser)
2. Some mechanism for creating new posts akin to a new post button. 
3. Must have some kind of “standard” to make it easy to implement and read.
3.5 must be able to live alongside an existing website without trouble. 
4. Must include some way to make posts pretty. 
5. Don’t waste too much time on this nonsense. 
6. Fun. 

Now i will talk you through my thought process and what I ended up doing. 

As I had settled on abandoning the bloat of a browser I settled on this new fangled “blog” running in the browser. I would create a little ncurses tool that allows you to write content read other people’s! Simple enough. I started developing straight away tapping at my keyboard this way and that. Line after line of beautiful C sprung from my fingertips, until... it dawned on my that everything I needed to do was already available to me. All I needed to do was join the bits together!

To BASH I ran. I wrote a small script that created incrementally numbered posts, it even inserted a post date and an underlined title for you. Taking advantage of the ansi escape sequences for setting tex colour provided the way to make text “pretty”

These files could be uploaded to an existing site, be read with the curl command and the text would come out nicely formatted. The curl blog (clog) was born. 

If we made it standard that these posts went in a /clog in your website root there would be a definite location for all existing clogs to exist!

I then chose to make the file “index” a mandatory file to have in your clog and it would list all of the available posts you could read in it. The new post script was changed to now put the new post at the end of the index file. 

You could just check if /clog/index existed to see if a site had a working clog. 

Long(er) story short I ran back to bash and wrote a tiny little clog viewer that can also manage bookmarks! 

Anyway this was just a bit of fun on an afternoon but as it turns out there are now three active clogs and a webring of clogs to match. 

For the curious: https://github.com/jameschip/clogs

And before anyone says or asks: yes this is just serving up text files. Yes someone probably has done something similar before. No this isn’t a serious project its just for fun and I don’t suggest people adopting it.

I manage a small dev team.  We recently launch a major project.  It has been a real death march.  Partly because of its size and partly because of bad choices from upper management.

Both me and my team have put in insane hours the last 6 months. I never once had to ask my team to do any over time.  They always stepped up and did whatever needed to happen with no prodding.  I am very proud of the work they and I did.  

I feel very bad they had to put in this much unpaid over time.  Our company took a financial hit with the pandemic, so chances of being able to give them a bonus are small.

I have told them many times how much I appreciate their extra work and now that we have launched, I have asked each them to schedule some time off.

I am asking for suggestions on anything I can do to show appreciation?  Especially now that our bonus budget has been cut.

,SoftwareEngineering,"I am not a developer in any way. I'm just a musician with a great idea. I'm just wondering how challenging it would be to pull off...

Here's my concept:

Musicians have been using live looping pedals and software increasingly more over time (Boss Rc-505, Abelton), and live streaming has effectively become the new industry standard for working musicians to perform. As much as I would love to watch myself and other live looping artists click a pedal and stand there listening to my own sounds on loop as I prepare my next instrument, I think there's a more entertaining solution...

What I need is software that not only loops the audio, but the video with it! As you hit your first command, your software starts recording the audio and video. Then with a second command it instantly begins playback of both audio and video together as a ""track"", looping it indefinitely. All while the video automatically organizes itself in frame to never cover up the the shots. There would also be an audio mixer section where you can control the volume of each loop and reorder loops.

So you would probably need some way to predetermine how the layers interact with each other. As soon as you execute the first loop, you now effectively have 2 camera angles (one live, one looping). So the software would automatically transition into a new ""scene"" where both angles are showing next to each other. And as you add more loop layers, it seamlessly transitions into preset scenes determined by how many loops you have running. Eventually it would up looking like some Brady Bunch-esque video with only one of the frames live.

This would then need to be sent to video broadcasting software like Open Broadcaster Software using a video capture device source and be sent out for streaming.

I'm not certain how much RAM power this could potentially require because I'm sure there's no time to write the file to a disk. Especially at 1080p, although only 720p would be needed at most considering all streaming platforms only support a maximum bitrate of 4000-8000 anyway.

If anybody in the magical land on Reddit that has the resources can make my dream software possible, take the idea and run with it! I would love to help with the design and I would be forever in your debt.

I'm mainly curious about the challenge to usefulness ratio and if would even be worth a company's time to develop something this ambitious. Please discuss! I've always been interested in software development but have spent my years learning chords and lyrics instead.

I really enjoy coding, mostly just making games/websites/small projects for myself. I get chances at work to do some coding, but I would like to do more.

I've been looking for a new job (at the same company) and came across a SE job. They 'require' a BS in CS/related field, which I don't have (my current job also had that requirement so i am not sure how required it is?), but the languages and other skills i do have or have some knowledge at least.

I want to update my resume and apply, but i have a fear that I just wont be 'smart' enough to do it or be good at it.

&amp;#x200B;

Did anyone else feel like that when they started? Is there any training or ways I can improve myself to help remove the doubt?

,SoftwareEngineering,"When I started my work as developer (10y ago, after 5y of university) I read a some docs and all was realtively simple (.Net doc + jQuery + SQL).

I've learnt on my own and from older colleagues.

Now, since few years I feel that things are getting **crazy**!!! Each blog just shows limited piece of information, e.g.:

- concurrent updates to DB. It's so obvious topic, yet it's barely mentioned in any EFCore course. Some courses assumes like there's always 1 user and 1 machine. What if 2 editors edits same product in same time? 

- CQRS, one say use EventSourcing, another say use separate DBs for read and write, yet another that just different models are fine.

- distributed systems. One say use SQS, another says use Kafka. Other claim to use NServiceBus on top of it. Sure - it depends - but how someone without huge experience in distributed systems can make a good decision?

- or events dispatching: some push it directly to message bus, others use ""outbox"" pattern (I've spend days before I found blog where someone finally made distinction between internal and external events)

Little bit of knowledge at pluralsight, little bit at stackoverflow, little bit at YouTube, and little bit in blogs, etc.

Last thing I want is to reinvent a wheel and overengineer my project.

Do you also have like this? Always some piece of knowledge missing? Always some part of architecture done wrongly?

,SoftwareEngineering,"I’m making a chess game but need help on designing the basic architecture.

My problem is that I want there to be different game modes defining how the game logic behaves, while also having different ways to display graphics (In the terminal, a 2D GUI, and on a 3D board) 

My first thought was to have something like the following pseudocode

    class ChessGame {  
        ChessBoard board; //Model

    }  
With board, graphics, white, black all having a reference to their parent ChessGame, which is how they will communicate with the other sibling components. Each game mode would be a subclass ChessGame and override the makeMove method. 

** The problem is that a Controller might have to depend on the Graphics in order to select a move. For example, in a GUI interface, you would need to click on a piece in the view in order to make a move... and from inside my controller object I can’t just assume that my ChessGame instance has a GUI. **

,SoftwareEngineering,"I can't figure out how I want to be interviewed and I'm interviewing others.

Interviewing for a mid developer, approaches and issues...

To clarify my definition of a mid developer is someone who is capable of getting a set of requirements and producing working production ready software from them with little help for a majority of tasks once up to speed with the company. The design would be reviewed still by a senior developer, and someone would do a code review and user testing after of course.

Phone call: Talk, see how the person fits, talk about past experience, what they would do in certain situations... This doesn't test anything about ability and could be good for a junior hire that is expected to learn on a the job or a senior hire that is expected to run the team instead of coding where different skills are actually needed.

White boarding: Normally tests fundamentals, algos and data structures. A person with 5 years developing may just not have a use for the algo ask about or isn't up to date with the latest terminology... but the recent masters student who has 0 hands on coding can ace it. Hire them and after the expected onboarding time they are struggling to write code in projects with a quarter million lines because they are used to school one off projects.

In person (live) coding: Takes time from both sides, feels super pressured with someone watching what you are typing, and probably avoiding cheating (Google/Stack Overflow) even though that is what real life programming often is and expected.

Take Home Test/Project: Takes lots of time from person applying and viewed negatively due to this. It does test the persons ability to deliver especially in a COVID environment where everyone is WFH anyway. I think ""cheating"" is expected, if you can source a template, 20 packages and write 100 lines of code, great instead of 1000, great. The only thing I would say that is not allowed is copying entire program from the internet and having someone else to do it.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Just today I received a call from the hiring manager of a software company and apparently I've landed my first job as a software engineer! Holy crap do I feel like a hero! :D I mean, I feel like it's incredibly lucky that I was able to impress the company with my zero work experience enough to receive an offer during these times.

I haven't yet received the offer letter, and while I squirm in anticipation, I thought I would ask a few wage-related questions to the community. Namely, is it ridiculous for me to consider negotiating a salary after the offer comes through?

Early on, we discussed a figure which they agreed was reasonable (but then they made an ""iffy"" face over the video chat). I mentioned that I'm not hard-set on that number and he made a note of that.

The interviews were nothing but wonderful with the lead dev, hiring manager and CTO. High praise all around. Then today, the hiring manager playfully starts by telling me that they'd received a record-setting number of applicants in all his years at the company and that I'd climbed to the top and they'd like to bring me aboard. That I'd be receiving an official offer letter from HR soon and I'd come and pick up some gear before beginning.

Hallelujah!!

After the high wore off a bit, I realized there was no mention of salary.

Is this normal? Does that (probably... possibly)  mean they've agreed to the figure we discussed earlier? If it's lower than we discussed, do you think it's negotiable? Will they scoff at my counter-offer and snapback their original proposal and laugh at my face?

Okay so my background is I have done my Bachelors in CS and have been working with an MNC(the ecommerce giant) for the last 3 years. I was promoted to an SDE-2 after 2 years and now I'm working towards becoming an SDE-3. I have been a part of my team since the beginning and since last 6-8 months I have been feeling like my learning curve is almost flat and things are becoming boring.

I have an offer from a fintech startup where one of my friend works which has completed series A funding and the founder is second time entrepreneur who has sold his first startup for 300M $. The current team there is around 80 people.

As per my conversation with the manager of the team in the start-up, his selling point was that the learning opportunities are going to be immense and even if the startup does not work out in 3 years, I'll have enough technical knowledge to join as an SDE-3 back in my current company. And if it does, I could grow exponentially with it and reach higher levels as compared to a liner growth at my current MNC.


The other option I'm considering is joining a different team here at my current company which might be working on interesting things. I don't even know how long it'll take to become SDE-3 here since the attrition rate is very low here now and I see there are so many SDE-2s already. I'm also scared my knowledge base will be significantly lower than my friend at the startup 3-4 years from now. How do you think should I approach this decision? What are your thoughts?

Long story short, I have started work on a very large system for my company, and the system does have a fair number of tests written but the code written here seems pretty bad. I say ''seems'' because I'm only a Junior developer, but there are some things I do know about.

One thing I'm having difficulty with, for example, is with the constructors -- contain a lot of logic and and initialization of objects. I don't however grasp how to refactor them.

,SoftwareEngineering,"I'm getting confused. All articles and books I have read talk about using distributed transactions across multiple ""sites"" or partitions of the same database. But then I read an article talking about why they perform poorly in microservice architecture when using separate isolated databases. Assuming that each microservice uses the same database technology and supports distributed transactions (i.e. has support for 2PC and locking etc...) can each separate DB take part in distributed transactions? Or is it restricted to a single database across their partitions/sites? Also, I'm relatively new to this terminology so maybe I'm misunderstanding how partitions work, or what a ""site"" really is so please correct me if I'm wrong on this.

Sorry if this question is dumb, I'm just a uni student trying to make sense of how they work :)

&lt;p&gt;Most topic pages are arranged for an optimal learning experience, as opposed to overwhelming you with a massive list of resources. They come with the following sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overview (intuition)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tutorials (code)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Libraries (by application)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we cover the follow categories of topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frameworks (Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data (augmentation, preprocessing, versioning, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Algorithms (regression, CNNs, Transformers, GANs, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tasks (text classification, object detection, recsys, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modeling (pretraining, interpretability, compression, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End-to-end (production, serving, testing, CI/CD, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industries (health, more coming soon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collections (checklists, courses, interactive, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;

Also, it allows its users to show off their code quality ranking and score to their repository web-page using badges.

It also offers interactive visualization of code quality aspects (architecture, design, and implementation smells, metrics, their distribution, and trend). Also, it allows its users to show off their code quality ranking and score to their repository web-page using badges. We are also planning to make the code quality analysis and uploading of the generated report automated within GitHub Actions. What do you think about the platform? Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"An issue our team has noticed is that support is a rate. Every Nth event requires manual intervention. The issue that happens is some programmers deliver projects that haven't been touched in years since they were deployed and are heavily used every day, while others spend 1/4 of every sprint for the past many years supporting the projects they release.

When we look at the issues, it seems like very very minor issues. From that perspective, they're all very similar in performance. But those minor issues add up when make a huge difference in support costs.

I'm not talking about a single project. We have programmers who have been here for many years and have developed many many projects. Individually those projects have low support costs, but they only accumulate over time.

The resulting support cost of a project seems to be bimodal. Some people almost never have to support their systems and other people are constantly fixing some yet another ""unforeseen"" edge case.

When looking over system design difference, the systems with edge cases seem to handle edge cases as an implementation detail. Systems with few issues seem to be designed in a way to not even allow for these kinds of edge cases. It comes down to the difference between ""that shouldn't happen"" and ""that can't happen"".

Every Nth event requires manual intervention. The issue that happens is some programmers deliver projects that haven&amp;#39;t been touched in years since they were deployed and are heavily used every day, while others spend 1/4 of every sprint for the past many years supporting the projects they release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look at the issues, it seems like very very minor issues. From that perspective, they&amp;#39;re all very similar in performance. But those minor issues add up when make a huge difference in support costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not talking about a single project. We have programmers who have been here for many years and have developed many many projects. Individually those projects have low support costs, but they only accumulate over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting support cost of a project seems to be bimodal. Some people almost never have to support their systems and other people are constantly fixing some yet another &amp;quot;unforeseen&amp;quot; edge case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking over system design difference, the systems with edge cases seem to handle edge cases as an implementation detail. Systems with few issues seem to be designed in a way to not even allow for these kinds of edge cases. It comes down to the difference between &amp;quot;that shouldn&amp;#39;t happen&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;that can&amp;#39;t happen&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"I am newly out of an academic environment in a more professional setting as a software developer, and really love my job.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Computer Science isn't Software Engineering.

I figure it is best I just ask a question that is based on what I am interested in so..

IF, for example.. I had a problem solution situation. 

A golf course has a lot of grass, I need to build a sprinkling system that saves water, also is hooked up to solar, and is so simple to operate it either runs itself, or a 99-year-old could do it.  These are three different fields of engineering. 

Help explain  the concept for the physical system itself,  but not actually DESIGN the system. I love art and the final project more than anything don't get me wrong. So,  I know ideal the solar panels should be mirror colored and outside.  I know water runs through pipes and gravity and temperature are its friend and enemy all at once... But that isn't where I see me. 

How am I going to make sure this turns on, when this other system also turns off.  All of those functions to support  that the final process, and that entire programmed was executed and guess what, all you need to do is mow the grass.

Where do I fit in? 

I want to help make the program that runs it, and just that. I want to help make it convenient for the user, I can imagine having to press a button at the golf course... must be ravishing. (that really was a random example) 

That is what I think about,  what kind of information would the user want? Does that grass need to be mowed? I could think of a million things that the system would measure and share. I want to help it measure and share it with.... Golfers.

I also want a 11 year old to be able to teach a 100 year old how to work it.

Its goal? To help developers design code in a way that saves most time in the long run.

I was wondering if someone could share their successful/unsuccessful experience of switching to contract-based work? I would like to know more about real problems that you faced and how does it compare to being an employee?

Briefly about me, I am a software engineer with 8+ years of experience, doing mostly backend and data processing (Java, C++, C#, Python, etc). I have been with one of FAANG companies (in Canada) for last 4 years, but I am disgusted and tired. My Corp is a huge feature factory where the only thing that is valued is to deliver cr\*p as fast as you can. As a result, 90% of my time is wasted of putting out fires. I tried switching teams several times, but it is all about the same. Plus no real career growth and tons of bureaucracy.

This made me seriously think of switching to contract-based work. What I am seeking is: a) More fulfilling job (more coding, deliver nice things) and b) better career perspectives.  The only thing that really worries me is getting those contracts, I can't imagine having no job or contract to work on :)

I would really appreciate your input!

,SoftwareEngineering,"Not sure if this is the best area to ask.

I will also try to be quick and simple

I have a BS in Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, but outside of some basic programming classes 10 years ago, I really am new to the whole Computer Science, Engineer, Programmer, Software Engineer field. 

So here are my questions:

(1) With a BS in Computer Science &amp; Engineering, what kind of jobs are available to me? Granted, I know a large part of the industry is not just proving you have a degree - but having years of experience writing code or being involve in computers, but please any information would be helpful. 

(2) Is there a differ between Software Engineer and Programmer? What kind of hierarchy's are there for job responsibility and seniority? 

(3) You always hear how companies like Amazon work crazy hows. I def want to have my career be a part of my life, but with a family I wouldn't really want to turn my career into something where I work all the time. What kind of hours are we looking at for a typical engineer? Do you hear often that these workers are allowed to have flexibility to work from home often? Not just Amazon, but any of these companies who hire

(4) What are salaries at typical places. You always hear liek Amazon hires entry level software engineers for nearly 6 figures. Is that true? Whats the standard in the industry though? How high can you climb and still be realistic in job opportunity.

,SoftwareEngineering,"So we work with a particular open-source modular platform that's primarily plug-in-based and that isn't WordPress, and we provide our clients with online learning solutions tailored to their specific needs. 

Without going into too many details, our entire dev cycle is FUBAR. The senior devs don't support the decision to use any kind of deployment tools and it's more than likely the younger guys will be responsible for reinventing the wheel. 

Just to give you an idea of my working environment. 

But they pay me well and the name is an excellent first entry on my resume. 

The process goes like this: PMs meet with client to determine requirements. They start with UI/UX designs that make client happy with the flashy colors and smooth animations. Issue cards are determined. Devs come in last to learn about what they're supposed to implement. 

As you can probably tell, devs have little to no input on anything like design or architecture, yet even the senior level guys are subjected to this. We're basically just expected to glue plug-ins together to achieve the desired purpose or tailor a new plug-in to this client's needs that isn't going to be reusable given the timeframe we have to get it done. 

It's patchy work. Enter design guy who draws up fantastical wireframes that absolutely do not share the same ethos as said modular platform. He then proceeds to blame the front-end guys for not being able to achieve these galactical feats in drawing shit on Zeplin. We're then expected to translate this using our internal design system (because fuck popular frameworks like Bootstrap) that is very barebones and poorly documented. 

When we argue that these designs absolutely break the flow of the entire platform and will not provide consistency, design guy snickers and says ""no it can be done"" without sharing the knowledge he doesn't have to be able to make that claim. 

But he has a senior PM's ears because he's the only one she can have a conversation with without retreating into non-technical territory. He fucking draws shit on a whiteboard, I don't expect anything less. 

I was fine with all of this until he threw a couple of guys on my team under the bus on a call they weren't on today. He also wants to lecture me on his ""UX cookbook"" and how we can remedy this problem in future projects.

In contrast applying directly to the company&amp;#39;s sites has gotten me about 5 interviews since my job search which started 2 months ago. These recruiting farms are really irritating because they masquerade as legitimate recruiters but they are just farming for your info.&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello all,

I landed my first programming job 4 months ago, and the job itself is amazing, I am essentially handling the entire front-end development, working on the back end as well albeit less-so, researching frameworks/libraries, making proposals/presentations and releases, learning Git and Linux, it’s a wonderful learning opportunity and I enjoy the work. However, I am working with one other guy and only this one guy, and he is a very unpleasant person. Let’s just say, he ignores me when I greet him, super reluctant to talk to me/get to know me or work together on things, criticizes my coding methodology when he gets the chance (rightly so *sometimes*), AND HE FARTS (AND DENIES IT!!). So despite the wonderful job, I am seriously unhappy having to work two feet away from this guy, if I had other people to work/collaborate with or at least one friend here it would be fine, but the office isn’t set up like that, so I’m stuck with this smelly a#**@hole** in this work area away from everyone else. My question is, how should I go about looking for a new job? On my resume, should I put down that I’m currently employed as a developer and mention the company? Not mention the company? Should I try to go at it again with a bare resume (though with updated skills) in order to hide my tracks so to speak?

I have 12 months left of school before I graduate. I also have 1 YOE intern experience as fullstack SWE at IBM and Sequoia backed startup. Ideally I get a FAANG internship before I graduate so I convert to new grad offer easier.

Right now I’m comfortable with LC mediums and hards (230 solved) and will be applying these next few weeks for a winter/summer internship.

My question is whether or not I should take next term off to learn some core CS stuff. Operating systems/compilers/concurrency. I am not a CS student, so I have this chip on my shoulder for not learning these fundamentals.

I also think delaying graduation in this market would be beneficial, giving me more internship search time. Intern -&gt; new grad offer is easier than graduate -&gt; straight to new grad. For example, I heard Facebook mostly hires interns for their new grads

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi,

As part of my self-teaching journey in software engineering/design I tried to implement a simplified version of Uncle Bob's original example on SRP. My premise is as follows:

&gt; I got to implement a *Worker* class, whose info can be stored and payment can be calculated

Now, trying to make my modules independent, I came up with the following code (python)

```
# - - - - - - - - - - - - 
# Worker.py
# - - - - - - - - - - - - 
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, name, age, years_working):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.years_working = years_working

# - - - - - - - - - - - - 
# Accounting.py
# - - - - - - - - - - - - 
YEARS_WORKING_FACTOR = {
        ""SOLES"": 1000,
        ""DOLLARS"": 500
    }
WORKER_AGE_FACTOR = 300

def get_salary(worker, currency='DOLLARS'):
    return YEARS_WORKING_FACTOR[currency] * worker.years_working + WORKER_AGE_FACTOR * worker.age

# - - - - - - - - - - - - 
# DBManagement.py
# - - - - - - - - - - - - 
DB = []

def save_worker(worker):
    worker_info = worker.__dict__
    worker_info['salary'] = get_salary(worker, 'SOLES')
    DB.append(worker.__dict__)

```

Now here:

* If someone requires some modification on the *Worker* definition, I would only modify it's class contained in its own module
* If someone requires some aditional currency to calculate the salary, I would only modify or add a new YEARS\_WORKING\_FACTOR field into *Accounting.py* module
* If someone needed to change the database to something else (like a dict or SQL reference), I would need to only change the DBManagment.py module

But what if I now needed to store the salary into the DB using ""Euros"" or another currency not defined in *Accounting* module, requiring me to change both *Accounting* and *DBManagment* logic. Would this violate the SRP?

As part of my thesis project, I am conducting a Systematic Literature Review on data-driven techniques in requirements elicitation and prioritization. I have identified 13 techniques, suggested by research, that could improve the process of elicitation and prioritization. Our goal from this survey is to understand how well known these techniques are in practice. The survey takes about 3 minutes to fill out. I would appreciate it a lot if you could help me out by filling it.

I'm 16 and have just learned the basic fundamentals of C++ and C# so far. I'm really anxious and worried that I'm being too slow and that my skills will not be enough to take BSSE in college, which is two years from now. This anxiety is destroying my motivation to keep on learning, so I started to search if it's okay to take the course with little to none prior knowledge. Some say it's okay, but I still have doubts. I think I'm starting to lose passion, but I really don't want to.

A backstory:
I use to be passionate about being an illustrator since I was a child, but because of my parents pressuring me to excel in math, I didn't really have time to develop much. When I entered high school and joined the arts club (so I can finally have time to do what I enjoy), I saw that the people my age are significantly better than me, so it destroyed my passion for arts. The thought kept repeating in my head: ""You're too late. You're too late. You're too late."" I mean I still draw, but not as much anymore.

So I experimented: writing, photography, graphic design. I enjoyed all of them, but nothing really stuck with me. 

Just a year ago I discovered that I was pretty good at programming through our IT subject, so I decided that this will be my thing. I enjoyed figuring out how this and that works and sometimes I add more to the program. It all seemed like magic to me that it put a big smile on my face for the first time in a while (Maybe being pressured to do well in math helped this?). So I looked more into programming as a career path. I saw that a lot of people younger than me have started programming, and being the insecure person that I am, started comparing myself to them. 

""In two years, I'll be in college. I have done nothing significant but to learn the fundamentals of two languages, and I emphasize, just the fundamentals. I should just quit.""

""You're too late. You're too late. You're too late.""

I started attempting to motivate myself by watching software engineering tips, guides, etc. on Youtube, but that just made me more anxious and led me to a headache.

I&amp;#39;m really anxious and worried that I&amp;#39;m being too slow and that my skills will not be enough to take BSSE in college, which is two years from now. This anxiety is destroying my motivation to keep on learning, so I started to search if it&amp;#39;s okay to take the course with little to none prior knowledge. Some say it&amp;#39;s okay, but I still have doubts. I think I&amp;#39;m starting to lose passion, but I really don&amp;#39;t want to.&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hey guys.

I'm still new to Reddit, been lurking on it for a while. I also don't know if this is the right place to post this.

I'm new to the SE world. Graduated last year, landed a nice job this year and with my first 6 months under the belt I've been contemplating passive income.

At work we're doing a grad programme for the majority of the year, this takes up 2-3 weekends every 6 weeks. I've been learning a lot and at work my current responsibilities are creating nodejs micro services. I'm also getting some hands on experience with AWS which is really cool!

Currently I tend to do 50-60 hour work weeks without my weekend grad work. 

I've done the basics from computer repairs to hosting applications on my own little servers for side projects while I was studying. I like backend development a lot more than the front end, making things pretty feels like a lot of hassle. 😅

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still new to Reddit, been lurking on it for a while. I also don&amp;#39;t know if this is the right place to post this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m new to the SE world. Graduated last year, landed a nice job this year and with my first 6 months under the belt I&amp;#39;ve been contemplating passive income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At work we&amp;#39;re doing a grad programme for the majority of the year, this takes up 2-3 weekends every 6 weeks. I&amp;#39;ve been learning a lot and at work my current responsibilities are creating nodejs micro services. I&amp;#39;m also getting some hands on experience with AWS which is really cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I tend to do 50-60 hour work weeks without my weekend grad work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done the basics from computer repairs to hosting applications on my own little servers for side projects while I was studying. I like backend development a lot more than the front end, making things pretty feels like a lot of hassle. 😅&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"At my company, we have a ""queue"" system which is basically ""things that need to be done"". For instance when we get a new order, that order is placed on ""send confirmation email to customer"" and a bunch of other queues depending on what the customer has purchased. Some tasks span multiple queues (do this, then that).

We also have ""manual queues"" with a web UI listing all orders on each queue. Failed automatic queues are also listed. When an agent marks the order as manually handled for that queue, it can manually be put on the following queue if there is one.

This is all home made and works quite well for linear flows with branching. When a queue has processed an order it can put it on the next queue(s). But when one queue depends on two queues having finished before it, it becomes a mess to get it right and requires separately crafted solutions. So in short it works well for tree structures but not for DAGs (directed acyclic graphs).

I keep being asked to change things that are more personal preferences than actual requirements of the ticket. Code reviews drag on for days, which makes me feel unproductive and useless.

Am I the only one feeling like this? I would like to know how you cope with the critiques. Do you have discussions with the reviewer? or just make the changes? I hate conflict, so if I say I disagree with something and the reviewer insists that I make the change I just end up doing it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the rant, but I needed to get it off my chest, and would like to know other people feelings about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

Hey guys, i am currently writing my Master's Degree dissertation on Organizational Culture and Scrum adoption in Software Development Projects and I am looking to get some insight from software engineers that have professional experience working with Scrum 

&amp;#x200B;

The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of how organizational culture affects the adoption of the Scrum framework by software engineers across the industry.

The direct feedback from software engineers will give insight into another perspective that is often overlooked when talking about Scrum implementation, and that is the perspective of the actual development team that works with Scrum on a day to day basis.

,SoftwareEngineering,"I am an aspiring entrepreneur with a couple of ideas that I think are worth perusing, but I have very little technical skills and coding experience.

How would I find a skilled engineer as a co-founder to help me with these pursuits?

I feel if I pitched the idea to an engineer who saw no value in the idea, they wouldn't work with me. Conversely, I feel like an engineer who found lots of value in the idea would just execute something on their own with somebody who has better business acumen than me.

My current ideas are

1) learn to code and at least get the project up and running. Then find a co-founder once I need more complicated coding done. I do have some experience and would love to learn how to code myself, the only issue is that I suspect that my idea requires complex backend infrastructure and am also very serious about the UX and UI being near perfect.

2) Get prospective co-founder engineers to sign an Nda before I pitch them so that they cant steal my idea

3) Pitch the idea to software engineers anyway and stop being so worried about someone stealing my idea. If my idea could potentially be stolen and executed by an engineer who replaces me with someone who has better business acumen than me, then I was probably doomed from the start. I would hope that no engineer would be able to steal my idea and execute on it better than me, without me.

,SoftwareEngineering,"hi, I’m a third year engineering student currently questioning my career and post-grad life so I came to this sub to hopefully get some clarity. please excuse me if this is messy; I’m pretty lost in life right now so not sure where this post will go either lol. 

In my first semester of engineering, I took a coding course (C++) that taught the basics of coding from the very beginner concepts to classes/OOP. I entered a depressive episode towards the end of the semester so my knowledge on anything past classes or OOP related is pretty scarce. I also took a data structures &amp; algorithms class in my second year. I really struggled through it because I lacked a strong foundational knowledge in the pre-requisites in comparison to my peers who were familiar with the material because of the first year course and their previous internships in a software engineering role. 

My current view is that coding/software development isn’t for everyone, and I am one of those people. I’m not like my classmates who have learned and picked up coding quick, are now super knowledgeable and talented at coding because of internships, courses, side projects, etc. 

I did an internship in web development in my first year but it did not go very well. I was very lost and lacked direction and knowledge for all my tasks. After that experience, I told myself I’d never go back to a software engineering role because of how anxious I was and how incompetent I felt during that internship. 

Now, with the pandemic, I’ve been considering the direction that my career is heading because my past four internships have been a bit all over the place in different positions and industries (my engineering major is quite broad). I thought I would never do a dev internship again, but I’ve been considering re-learning how to code and explore software engineering a bit more. I’m just not sure if this is feasible or recommended. Should this switch even be something to consider? Should I just pursue a different career path? Thoughts?

TLDR: is it too late for me to become good at coding and pursue a software engineering career? is it possible for me to become as great as a “naturally talented” software engineer, and love it despite having a poor foundation in the basics?

,SoftwareEngineering,"I’ve been working in the IT field for about two years now (mainly tech support), and I already know it’s not for me. I’m a desktop support technician for a large university, and between having to climb on ladders to fix equipment/replace projectors and having a boss who’s been in the industry for 20+ years and is a micromanager/completely stuck in his ways, I’m just over it.

When I was first breaking into the field, a lot of people told me I should instead look into software engineering/development because of my personality and the pay.

I earned a B+ in the course, but it was unnaturally difficult for me, and I was overwhelmed the entire time (prior to the class I never had any exposure with a programming language).

Given that I’ve had this much difficulty with Java in the past, would it still be possible to become a software engineer and focus more on other languages?

,SoftwareEngineering,"Please let me know if you have feedback on this plan to upskill before leaving management consulting. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Main Goal:** Be in a position to get software engineering, data scientist, and ML engineering job offers after I leave management consulting.

  
**Secondary Goals:** Spend more time building skills that I can apply to my consulting work, avoid making my colleagues suspect that I want to leave consulting,  get enough product engineering skills to develop my own platform / app, and not spend more money than I have to.

&amp;#x200B;

**Timeframe:** 2-3 years

  
**Plan Steps (while working full-time):**

1. I'll continue my [applied ML course ](https://emeritus.org/university-courses-online/applied-machine-learning/) (not self-paced) until it's over in September, taking additional side courses in linear algebra as necessary.
2. After that, I'll take 2 other important python courses to close knowledge gaps - [Python to Access Web Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data?specialization=python) and [Accessing Databases with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases?specialization=python) \- simultaneously (not self-paced, 4 weeks) 
3. After that, I'll resume my [web developer bootcamp course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) (self-paced), which I started a year ago and I'm halfway through. No ruby, but it covers javascript pretty thoroughly.
4. After that, I'll enroll in a [ML Engineering course](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t) (self-paced but estimated \~3 months) which ideally would build on what I've learned in the previous courses.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi everyone! Long time lurker first time poster here.

I'm a Software Engineer with an experience of just about 4 years. I am feeling kind of stuck and I'm not sure whether I'm overthinking about it or not.

I'm working mostly with Microsoft tech stack revolving around Dynamics AX along with .NET for any integration, middleware etc.

For a while now I'm feeling like I'm stuck working on such a specific ""product"" you could say and that I'm limiting my options if I ever want to try and do something else moving forward. I mean sure I like working with the tech but I believe it's restricting me from experiencing some more traditional development that's going on like building whole applications from the ground up and all that.

Lately I've been applying to A LOT of different companies for a Software Engineer position, for .NET and C# positions but I THINK I'm being rejected without even going through a test or anything because my CV basically screams Dynamics AX at this point and people think that hinders my ability to code because it's such a specific product that I'm working on. That's not really helping my mental state. I constantly think that I'm just not even a decent enough developer.

Although to be fair I'm mostly applying in European companies while I'm still in Asia so the whole needing a work VISA and all might be a reason for the rejection too but I guess you guys can comment better on this.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi Everyone!

I will start with a short intro about myself. I’m 29 years old and live in Europe. I have worked in finance for almost 8 years now . 

At my current company I have been doing anything except for finance. I’m a mix between Implementation Manager and Product Owner. I basically tell the developers what to design so we can launch the software and finish the project. I handle the testing, project timeline, kanban Board and communication with customers about their feedback and/or issues. 

I have introduced myself to the coding part of the process 4 months ago and I realized that this is what I actually want to do. I want to have a career switch and become a software engineer. I’m doing an online free course for introduction to Python where I learned the basics and have to do 2 projects ( starting with the first one now).

My question is : Should I enroll at university and study a bachelors on Software Engineering ? Or should I do some free courses on my own and just build up a portfolio to show what I can do on interviews? 

I have a full list of free courses ( coursera, Udemy , Bootcamp and YouTube ) that I have looked into but I’m just struggling with the idea that I won’t get hired or maybe not have the same career opportunities with a bachelors or without one.

,SoftwareEngineering,"My husband has been looking for an entry level software engineer position since December 2019 without any luck. Yesterday, he once again told me that he’s got a rejection email from a company where he thought he had a great interview at. 

Back story: My husband and I are in our mid 30s living in NYC and we’ve been married for 7 years. 4 years ago he was working in sales and marketing, he wasn’t thriving and got tired of his job. He started to learn coding by himself and decided that coding is something he would be enjoy doing as a job. After some thinking, he and I both agreed that he should quit his job and go to a 3 month coding boot camp to see if this can turn into something he would be love doing. 

3 month past, after several failed attempts for the boot camp entry exams, he then decided that he wanted to get a bachelor’s degree for computer science since he realized that boot camps are not legit. He already has a bachelors degree in marketing and business. I struggled to agree with that since that would take him 3-4 more years to finish. Even though I have a pretty decent job and salary(I am not a software engineer), I still think that’s a lot burdens on my shoulder which I am not ready for. He had always make less than me before he quit his job, but I would never thought that I will have to pay for all expenses while he’s in school for 3-4 years. It’s expensive living in NYC. I disagreed at first but he insisted and got his parents involved. They begged me to let him go to school and just suck up for 4 years. they said they will help as much as possible. I looked at him and knowing that he hates his old job and I agreed. 

Luckily he was able to get his bachelors degree in computer science in 3.5 years and during this time, not only I was working full time to financially support him and myself, I was also the one that cleans and cooks since he was always busy studying. His parents did not help much as they said they would. but I was looking forward for him to finish so he can finally have a job. Because if this, I did not buy anything  nice or go to vacations for 4 years. Thinking about us finally can enjoy our lives a little bit kept me going during these 4 years. 

Little did I know, 7 month after he graduated, he still did not get an offer. He applied numerous job applications since December and got a few interviews. Right before the lockdown started for Covid, he was interviewing at 3 different companies. He said he was doing great. When covid started, 2 of the companies paused hiring. The last company had 3 technical interviews with him, on his final interview, they had 5 software engineers on the zoom call asking him technical questions and he said he aced it. We were excited and thought that this was going to be his big break. But after 2 month and several follow up emails, he got a rejection email during the lock down. Covid and the economy definitely does not help with his job searching. Finally he got an interview at a big company last week, he answered all the technical questions correctly during the interview(he asked the interviewer at the end), still a rejection....

I am emotionally and financially drained from his situation. Every time I think about his situation, I just fall into a depression episode. I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel... Sorry about the ramble. But can anybody who has the experience tell me if it is true that it’s this difficult to find a entry level software developer job? Is it because he’s unlucky or is he not good enough? 

here is his programming skills he listed on his resume:

• JavaScript, jQuery, Java, PHP
• C++, Node.js, Express.js, Heroku, React and Redux, Angular
• MongoDB, mySQL, SQL
• HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, EJS

He doesn’t know that I am posting this on Reddit. I needed some advice and insight from someone else other than him. Thanks for any feedback..


Edit: I forgot to mention that he did have 2 internships during his school years. He also is searching everywhere not limited to NYC.


Edit: thank you all for your valuable feedback. I feel a little less sad and a little more encouraged now. I wish I can help him as much as I can but my knowledge to this industry is so limited. At this point he has no choice but keep at it with your advices. Thankfully he has not been discouraged at all with the rejections and he’s been studying harder and harder. Hopefully he will get more technical interviews so that he can be more motivated. 🙏🏼",t2_440dxal8,False,,0,False,Is it really this hard to find a entry level software engineer job?,[],r/SoftwareEngineering,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_hjdoxy,False,dark,0.94,,public,42,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,42,,False,self,1593740836.0,,[],{},,True,,1593649975.0,text,6,,,text,self.SoftwareEngineering,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband has been looking for an entry level software engineer position since December 2019 without any luck.

&lt;p&gt;Little did I know, 7 month after he graduated, he still did not get an offer. He applied numerous job applications since December and got a few interviews. Right before the lockdown started for Covid, he was interviewing at 3 different companies. He said he was doing great. When covid started, 2 of the companies paused hiring. The last company had 3 technical interviews with him, on his final interview, they had 5 software engineers on the zoom call asking him technical questions and he said he aced it. We were excited and thought that this was going to be his big break. But after 2 month and several follow up emails, he got a rejection email during the lock down. Covid and the economy definitely does not help with his job searching. Finally he got an interview at a big company last week, he answered all the technical questions correctly during the interview(he asked the interviewer at the end), still a rejection....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am emotionally and financially drained from his situation. Every time I think about his situation, I just fall into a depression episode. I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel... Sorry about the ramble. But can anybody who has the experience tell me if it is true that it’s this difficult to find a entry level software developer job? Is it because he’s unlucky or is he not good enough? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here is his programming skills he listed on his resume:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• JavaScript, jQuery, Java, PHP
• C++, Node.js, Express.js, Heroku, React and Redux, Angular
• MongoDB, mySQL, SQL
• HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, EJS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He doesn’t know that I am posting this on Reddit. I needed some advice and insight from someone else other than him. Thanks for any feedback..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I forgot to mention that he did have 2 internships during his school years. He also is searching everywhere not limited to NYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: thank you all for your valuable feedback. I feel a little less sad and a little more encouraged now. I wish I can help him as much as I can but my knowledge to this industry is so limited. At this point he has no choice but keep at it with your advices. Thankfully he has not been discouraged at all with the rejections and he’s been studying harder and harder. Hopefully he will get more technical interviews so that he can be more motivated. 🙏🏼&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"(It might be a bit ranty, but help me clean up my understanding, or just stay for the anecdotes.)

Being in the software world for some time, I have my steady stream of incoming generic requests and messages about jobs on Linkedin. If you've been working in software, you probably know what I'm talking about, it is probably not unique to me. If not, you can draw a parallel, between being a hot girl on tinder and being a software engineer on Linkedin. Your seniority is the analog for the amount of cleavage displayed on your photos, the recruiters are the guys trying to get your attention, and your profile is your tinder-bio, which they won't read until you actually respond.

Recruiters, their existence just boggles me. What is the added benefit, other than the means for a wealty company to buy attention, through human-disguised ads, and shameless attempts to slip in your DMs? I've been interviewing with companies, and I've been interviewing candidates who are represented by agents, so I see those two angles, but not the recruiters'.

From the engineer's perspective, I don't think it makes a lot of sense. My experience so far has only been poor. (Here's where your views can come in).

* I see how they try to oversell me to the company, and oversell the company to me.
* They try to act important throughout the process, they'd try to get my view on the interviews, and offer help for the next ones (I never really understood how they could be of any help in preparing for a technical interview in any shape, but maybe this is circumstancial).
* They act as a middle-man between me and the company, introducing delays in communication, miscommunication and headache just in general.
* Ultimately, they'll take a cut of my salary. It's of course not directly from my salary, but the money the company has to pay them as an extra goes from the same budget that I'm getting my draw from.

From the companies' perspective, they're bringing an expensive but steady stream of incoming candidates, with an extra premium on a successful hire. But they also act as cannibals trying to tear out other employees of yours with promises of a brighter, richer future.

From the recruiter's side, this completely makes sense. It's a lucrative business. They get a hefty cut of the engineers' salary for their search. Once the engineer is placed, champagne pops and onto the next one. You can promise anything to get them going, and if the offer is not great, you're still good with almost no investment in-between.

And most of this work can be EASILY replaced by a robot - since all my interactions with recruiters, especially in the early phases are completely repetitive and bland. Same questions, different reader on the other end. I would like to believe, that robots can actually tell the difference between Java and Javascript. This job should be an extremely endangered one, and yet, they spread like fungi on wet cowdung.

Of course, I have heard of really great recruiters, people who actually take this by heart, and they're finding good positions, but from my sample size and experience, this must be a rare sight.

So - what am I missing? Is it anything like this in other industries? Am I really seeing for what it is?

Coming from the video production industry I've already faced a monumental amount of rejection. I've been actively learning video production since the age of 12 and entered college with skills far beyond what any other video producer in my university was ever capable of. I considered myself on par skills-wise with big-name studio employees like video producers at HBO and Universal and all my professors assured me I could easily jump into the industry with my skillset. However, it took me 18 months to get an entry-level job making $38k in the DC area. I think that's why this career change has been so daunting. Hearing your input about SWE is wonderful. I can really say so far I have a passion for it. I enjoy learning and both my parents have been software engineers since the early '80s and I'm excited to follow in their footsteps.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently enrolled in an online cohort which is starting soon. I'm extremely excited and found the pre-modules to be easy to follow and realized I'm quick at learning this stuff after also doing a few projects I found online. I also realized how interested I am in coding and understanding how it all works. However, I'm worried about after the program.

So far, I haven't found any negative experiences online about getting a job but it still sounds a little too good to be true. They claim 95% of graduates get a job paying over $95k if you're willing to move to the San Francisco area and I am willing. I just worry from a logical standpoint trying to think of a reason why a company would want to hire someone who only has AppAcademy on their resume applying to be a software engineer. I've been a video producer for the last 5 years and have a lot of creative experience with web design and user experience which might be a plus and I also have a bachelor's degree in Telecommunications.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Since few years I'm very much into clean: code, architecture, functions, designs. I've spend too many days being frustrated dealing with convoluted source code and systems.

However, I'm slowly loosing hope. As example let me tell ""domain events"". I'm researching this toopic since few weeks. Here what I've found:

- dispatch before committing
- dispatch after committing
- divide into ""internal"" and ""external"" domain events, dispatch ""external"" after committing
- to ensure at-least-one delivery of ""external"" events, create outbox patter
- use domain events to communicate between bounded context only, within bound context use normal program flow
- use domain events also to communicate between aggregates
- trigger one domain event per command
- don't trigger domain events in commands, only in aggregates
- trigger domain events also in entities of aggregates
- store domain events in per-aggregate table
- store domain events in per-bounded-context table/store

... and more. The above are from blogs of many great developers (Udi, Khorikov, etc.) and very often they are in contradiction to each other.

Why in our industry it's so convoluted? Barely any standards if it is about more complex things than CRUD.

I know each system is different, but unless you're google or amazon, there should be pretty standard templates, e.g.:

- basic crud
- medium size ddd, cqrs (single monolith)

So I started playing around with a docker-compose file and managed to set a functional workspace that allows for developing both themes and plugins for Wordpress.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hey everyone,   


We do interviews with accomplished tech leaders on our podcast (Level-up Engineering) and in our recent episode, we had  Sarah Wells, Technical Director at Financial Times as our guest. Sarah shares some useful tips on how they built FT's engineering brand over the years.  


**Sharing some key insights here:**

1. The first challenge is that you may not know what your brand is. The topic of your engineering brand doesn’t tend to come up until you start thinking about how to represent it.

2. The second challenge is that it takes time and effort. Building your brand isn’t an engineering task, but you need people who take it seriously and keep up the effort. You want people to know that they can come back later for more great stuff to have a real impact.

3. When we started speaking at conferences and writing blog posts we realized that our own team is a key audience. Your blog is an effective way to communicate with your engineers.

,SoftwareEngineering,"With some reflection, I am dismayed at the tools at our disposal for encapsulation, and concurrently our appreciation of it. ""Public"" everything is all too common with occasional extracts of private methods.

It is my feeling this comes at an expensive cognitive cost to work with the code. Encapsulation constrains and organizes the surface area of the code.  By surface area, I mean what must be considered for understanding the code from the context of a business perspective, a calling perspective in code, or a dependency perspective.

At one extreme where everything sees everything else (public everything) there are very few assertions that are readily available when reading the code. You must manually enumerate the structure through static analysis. From a consuming perspective you have to manually delineate what the useful structure is from the non-useful structure. This can be exhausting for complex problems.

On the other extreme where everything is encapsulated well and locked down, assertions become self-evident. You only have to work with what you can see. The code communicates it's useful structure in a clear way.

So a few things:

1. In .NET projects are a great encapsulation tool, but often projects are used as layers which must effectively have fully public members to everything above them. We seem to like projects for organization *because they feel* like they express a stronger split than folders, but in practice they are often just fancy folders at the cost of losing a great tool of encapsulation with *internal.*
2. I may need more consideration of doing more with libraries, but it is a bummer the JavaScript ecosystem doesn't have easy encapsulation beyond private/public in tandem with file organization.
3. I wish tooling had better support for expressing encapsulation as part of the structure you browse the project with. (e.g. relationship information communicated in folder/file explorers)
4. I'm not sure what it would look and feel like when the rubber hits the road, but I really wish there were additional ways to encapsulate things based on scope/namespace; and with this , is the necessity of expressing those relationships in a useful way when navigating code.

In the end if we were better able to do these things, I think they'd allow code that is much easier to understand and navigate. Much of our cognitive load is in tracking code and figuring it out.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Here's every advice (or mistake to avoid) I can think of when building your resume. This is all based on my humble experience reviewing 500+ resumes as Head of Engineering at a tech company:

**Shortlist your skills**

Please don't mention every technology, framework or language you've ever encountered or studied in college. Yes it might show that you're familiar with C#, Java, PHP, .NET, MySQL, Oracle, C, C++, HTML, Python, CCNA, TCP/IP, Photoshop.

But let's be real, it also shows you're a [jack of all trades and master of none](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_of_all_trades,_master_of_none). It might not be true, but it hurts you more than it helps you.

**Break down skills by proficiency**

This one is more of an advice and less of a mistake. Instead of breaking down your skills by category (e.g Databases, Frameworks, Networking ...). It's usually better to break it down by proficiency (e.g Familiar with, Experienced in ...)

Here's how it looks like in real life:

    Proficient in: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Docker
    Experienced with: Postgres, React, Git, Javascript
    Familiar with: Kubernetes, Redis, Angular, MongoDB, ElasticSearch

**Add details to experiences**

If the ""experiences"" block on your resume is basically names of companies and dates, your chances of getting your dream job just went down by 50%.

Instead try to write 3-4 sentences under each experience explaining what the project was about, how you were involved (as an individual) and some of the things you achieved on the project. If you can mention stats (optimized page response time by 30%), that's even better.

**Avoid spelling and grammar mistakes**

Why should anyone care about typos if you're applying for a technical role? Well two things:

* It shows a possible lack of attention to details. If you're gonna make typos on your resume, there is a high chance you gonna leave typos in emails, technical documentation, Slack and everything in between. There is exception to this rule as anything else in life, but it's more likely to be true than not.
* It shows a possible lack of proficiency with whatever language you're using.

What can you do about this? Besides auto-correct, use Grammarly (it's free) or have a friend review your resume before you hit send.

**Move ""Education"" block to the bottom**

This is especially true if you're applying to tech companies in Morocco or abroad. Start with your experiences (professional and personal), then move to skills and language proficiency, then finish with education. When it comes to hobbies, keep it reasonable but also original.

**Keep it visually simple**

If you're applying for a technical role, your resume can look as simple as a README on Github. But here's my [favorite resume template of all time](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/joshua-taylor-eppinettes-resume/wcsdpbkfmstz).

A good resume, first and foremost, should be easy to read, informative, interesting, typos-free then maybe visually beautiful.

And yes, your resume might stand out if it's all colorful and original, but then again, your experiences, skills and side projects should take care of that.

**Keep it to one page (Preferably)**

If you have less than 6-10 years experience. Please keep it to one page.

If you keep jumping between jobs and can't fit everything into one page, focus on the experience that are most relevant for the job role you're applying for. Also you might wanna skip some of those internships.

**Make it relevant (Preferably)**

Doesn't mean one resume per company, but also it doesn't have to be [one resume to rule them all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Ring). If you're applying to multiple job roles or companies in different industries, it might be an interesting idea to create multiple variations.

For example if you're applying to companies in banking but also a tech startup, you might want to create one resume variation where you highlight more your experience with banking software. And then another variation where you highlight more your experience at a similar tech startup.",t2_i7un6,False,,0,False,Few Hacks For Your Next Tech Resume,[],r/SoftwareEngineering,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_hcgtj5,False,dark,0.95,,public,60,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,60,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1592661492.0,text,6,,,text,self.SoftwareEngineering,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s every advice (or mistake to avoid) I can think of when building your resume.

I know so many people are struggling to find jobs at the moment and perhaps I'm lucky to still have one (at the moment)

However I've been looking to move from embedded software development into web development however I am finding very difficult to break into the field.

I did an undergrad in electrical and electronic engineering and done a year internship at an automotive company. It was my first time working on software and I enjoyed it. I did fairly well in the internship and they offered me a graduate job half way through. I went back to university completed my degree and went back. I continued working in the same team and was then in charge of leading development for a client project and became lead of the project team. Things looked fine but I wasn't happy...

There were many problems with the company and the way it operated and I could not see myself developing as a better software engineer. In addition to this my tech stack was limited to C and proprietary automotive tools. I felt like I was in a stalemate whilst my fellow grads went onto doing amazing things.

So I branched out and took the initiative to improve myself.

I've completed web development course and even created a small Todo list app and learnt the full web stack. I also worked on an Android app which used machine learning to classify images in real time as well as deploying machine learning on an FPGA embedded device . Please note here I used a lot of tutorials and help online to create these items

Currently working on developing my skills in react and flutter but got a long way to go till I ship my first webapp/app

However I know I have a very long way to go to really call myself an engineer in web development or data engineering. In order to get better in these areas I needed to gain commercial experience.

I've been applying to these jobs, it's been 6 months since I started learning and applying to different jobs. Results so far:
Over 100 applications
Failed 97 before CV stage or company never got back to me and got ghosted
2 companies had a phone interview and we're happy with proceeding but they didn't get back to me so i chased them up and they ghosted me
1 company I got to the final stage and I made clear to them that I had a weakness in object oriented programming in the first interview however I was told that don't worry I would be trained on it only then to be tested on OOP knowledge on my final interview. It was very saddening because my previous two interviews I had very positive feedback. Im still waiting to hear back but hell it was one of the worst interviews of my life.

I've applied to graduate positions too but they are looking for new grads and not my year or I failed that part of the hiring process.

So really right now I'm thinking what can I do is it a case of just keep applying or is there something I need to do more?

Today Agile is the default  choice for the software development life cycle (SDLC); every conference,  book, or blog post is telling us we are doomed to fail if we don’t  follow this established convention. But isn’t it surprising to think  that we should use Agile for every possible company doing software out  there? Are we going to organize software development exactly the same  way if we work for a startup, NASA, or FedEx? It seems hard to believe.

If you are already screaming *this is heresy! …p*lease  bear with me; I am not trying to send us back to the dark ages of  Waterfall. At the same time, no project or company is the same and we  should keep thinking about *Why* we do what we do. Choosing the appropriate SDLC requires a deep understanding of the dynamics of your environment.

In this blog post, I will use the lenses of risk management to help you  pick what SDLC is right for you. We will first look at how to put your software development lifecycle into context by interpreting it as a risk  map. We will then look briefly at the history of Agile and Waterfall and why these risk maps make sense in their own context. Finally, we are  going to learn how to use Cynefin and Wardley maps as tools to better  understand the uniqueness of your risk territory, so you can pick the  software lifecycle that better suits your team or company profile.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello ,  


I have an interesting problem at hand . I'm building a inventory management application for Textile manufacturing business .  
Now I have almost 5000 items for which I need to track the quantity .  
Currently , I am processing them in real time when the user requests them , which was running fine when I was running in dev , but moving to production my 5$ droplets takes quite a bit of time to process it.  


So this is the usual workflow of processing the inventory - &gt;

1. Get all the transactions associated with the required item
2. Traverse them and calculate the balance qty
3. Return qty.

The transactions are the movements of the item made by the user.

Now the problem is that the transactions will increase exponentially with time , so at a later stage the above flow would take a heck lot of time to compute.   
So what would be a better approach for this?  


Currently I'm thinking of keeping a one to one mapping of the item &amp; the quantity which updates when ever a transaction is made , so that when the user requests, it would be instant .   


Any thoughts &amp; suggestions would be much appreciated.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi everyone!

My name's Christian, and I'd like to share what we've been building at [OrgStack](https://orgstack.io/).  I'm posting this here as a ""request for feedback"" from the community that we serve.

Poor data quality is a costly problem for many organizations.  Invalid data is responsible for major product/service outages, and it can be very  difficult to pinpoint the root cause of data-related incidents.  This requires a large investment of engineering resources.

OrgStack aims to streamline the process of managing data sources, receiving critical alerts, and tracing incidents to their source.  While building a solution to this problem, we drew inspiration from some of our favorite tools, including NPM, Loggly, and Jenkins.

A few baseline questions:

* Is data validation / data quality currently a problem for you?
* How do you solve it now?
* Which differentiating features would get you to switch?
* What would your ideal solution look like?

Thanks in advance for your feedback.  We really appreciate it!

,SoftwareEngineering,"Dear GitHub,

Nobody cares what you think about anything that's not related to programming. Period—ah shit that's probably offensive, I mean Full Stop.

Not a single solitary racist's mind will be changed because of what you're doing. This can only have one effect: non-racists will get pissed because you're creating work for them, and racists will get pissed because you're creating a race issue where there was none and they will become even more entrenched in their viewpoints. You've failed to think through the consequences of your actions even a little bit.

How many tens of thousands of man hours—oops, I mean non-gender-conforming-person hours—will be wasted so you can finally feel good about yourselves? How many scripts assume a master branch and will have to be changed? How many workflows is the master branch baked into? How many millions of people will have to re-train their muscle memory—shit, that's offensive because of toxic masculinity...uh, body-positive memory—to cater to your whims?

The answer to all of these questions is a Whole Fucking Lot. Sadly, the damage here is largely done. Before this, there were maybe half a dozen people on the planet that ever looked at ""master branch"" and made a slavery connection. Now every programmer will. Forever. You've done infinitely more harm than good with your self righteousness. Please don't make this change.

,SoftwareEngineering,"So here's my background, about 2 years ago, with no experience, I broke into the IT field (MSP/helpdesk) and rose to my current position of Level 3 Helpdesk / Project Manager. I am highly motivated and genuinely enjoy challenges and structuring out processes. I was gifted with the opportunity to build out our Projects department and design the structure that Projects are managed in at my company.


Some time later, I got the chance to dip my toe into Powershell and it just clicked. I took on any opportunity to script that I could. Now I understand that programming languages are a bit different from Powershell, but scripting just makes sense to me, I'm hoping programming languages are similar. 


To get to the point, I'm interested in switching careers. Right now I want to get into software engineering/development, but eventually I'd like to make my way into some sort of Machine Learning role. From my understanding, strong software engineering experience is essential to getting into a Machine Learning Engineer position. I do not have any sort of degree at all, but from what I can gather, it is possible to get into software engineering/development without a degree so long as you know what you're doing. So I started looking into Programming/Software bootcamps (Lighthouse Labs, Hackreactor, Turing). These are not cheap bootcamps. I am not opposed to going back to college if necessary. I just want to know the best path to get into this career field. I know that this is what I want to do. 



My questions are:



What do employers look for in a Software Engineering candidate specifically? 


What languages should I focus on? 


Are bootcamps worth the time/money?

If so:

Which bootcamps are the most respected?
Which bootcamps would you recommend? 
In addition to bootcamps, what other resources would be worth investigating? 


If not:

What alternatives would you recommend? 
Would an online Bachelors in CS be worth the time and money for these goals? (I already have a full time job in IT, so online is my only option. WGU is the first that comes to mind.)

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy writing mobile apps and they rely heavily on pre-documentation and mock-ups. And I suck at both. Now I need advice on how to catch up with that. 😐&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"My main job is developing a parser for a specific type of PDF document. For the most part the documents have the same general content and structure (as they are legally required to follow a certain standard), but because the documents are often written by people, formatting tends to vary wildly and there are many idiosyncrasies I must accommodate. 

My current approach has been creating very complex and long regex patterns, sometimes entire arrays of regex patterns all attempting to parse the same piece of data. Often there is a method dedicated to parsing each individual piece of data, which tries multiple patterns, often in a specific order, and through a variety of logical gymnastics eventually finds the right piece of data for most documents. 

Whenever parsing fails for a certain piece of data for a certain document, that becomes a new bug fix ticket. Most of the time adapting to a new format for a piece of data is just a matter of appending a new regex pattern to an existing long pattern or an array of patterns. On a regular basis, do some QA with new documents, create tickets, add patterns. It’s very efficient now, and maintenance is fairly simple, but the code is getting out of hand. 

This is all done in a very barebones ruby/Sinatra app. Currently the text is broken up into semantic chunks, and there is a class dedicated to parsing each chunk. Some classes are fairly simple and the regex patterns can fit within the class without creating too much of a mess. For others however, I’ve had to move hundreds of lines of regex patterns into their own class to be imported into the parser class, just to keep the code clean and avoid needing to scroll past 200 lines of regex constants just to find the first method. 

I know this problem is only going to get worse, and I imagine I’m not the first person to develop a complicated, niche parser, so I’m wondering if there is a better way to do this or any existing conventions regarding complex parsing. This solution I came to on my own, with little to no guidance, and now that this task is a huge part of my job I want to know if I’m going about it in a sane way.

I am doing my masters thesis at the University of Zurich in Switzerland. I developed a tool that supports code review. It integrates in to GitLab and visualizes the code change in an interactive graph, i.e., shows class and method call dependencies.

,SoftwareEngineering,"I guess this is more of a rant than only a question.

I was in a company that used Adobe Experience Manager (AEM, it's a CMS) and I hated it. 

I then started a job at a new place and surprise surprise, they were using AEM too. 

AEM Development is sooo slow and the CMS instance gets ""corrupted"" every once in a while and you have to solve it or reinstall it and it's just so pointless. 

Sometimes building and installing your solution takes ages even if it's one line of code. Sometimes you can use AEM's ""crx"" tool to introduce your files manually into the CMS... I don't know who thought that pattern --or whatever that is-- was a good idea.


AEM never works, that's my main complain. You spend more time trying to get the CMS to do what you want, than actually making the code change you need to make. It's frustrating.

,SoftwareEngineering,"I recently joined a telecom corporate as a software engineer, I was very excited to work there but then after I joined,I found that the work flow there is very different from what I was used to. 
Every thing must be done through a request, and it took me months to receive my corporate laptop, a laptop that I don’t even have admin privileges on by the way and so if I need to install a new app or use a new technology it must follow a chain of approvals which makes me feel like my hands are tide everytime I want to try a new thing.
This corporate relies heavily on tools, everyone use tools there, so when I joined I was given a ""tutorial' on the tool my team uses, the tutor is an old member of the team because the tool has no community online, no documentations or discussion boards, no nothing. Anyway, in the videos the tutor keeps explaining the tool as if he was explaining it to children; literally saying stuff like 'press the yellow button on the upper corner then the green one next to it to add a new rule'. 
My team members and my team leader act like this is the software industry; using tools like end users. They use big words out of the context or in the wrong sentences to sound smart which was very confusing at first, because I used to try to make sense out of them. 
Now it has been six months, I only get to work on stupid ""project"", that are being treated as great milestones in the history of mankind -sorry for the sarcasm- and by projects I mean using the said tools to add new ""service"". ZERO CODING 100% Monkey work.

All of saidit's posts are saved and mirrored, in real-time, on notabug's servers. You can see that content easily here: 

https://notabug.io/t/saidit.all


Likewise, now saidit also is hosting notabug's mirror on saidit! So you can see notabug post backups any time at: 

https://notabug.saidit.net/


This will not affect how saidit operates, nor will it affect how notabug operates. It's merely a way for each of us to support the other, so both of us are more stable and have our data backed up in an additional way, that is also publicly viewable. This means if saidit ever was to go down permanently for some reason, the notabug backup would continue to exist. And likewise if notabug ever goes down permanently, the data will all be stored on saidit, available to the public. 

We are calling our new cooperative effort the DFF: Decentralized Forum Federation. 

Thank you to /u/go1dfish, who is the owner of notabug and built this post-mirroring system. If you haven't checked out notabug before, please do at www.notabug.io. It's one of the best reddit alternatives available, along with saidit.

,SoftwareEngineering,"In the past, I worked for a company that grew way too fast in the last 20 years.There are layers upon layers of horrible spaghetti and nothing gets done anymore because SW complexity is higher than devs can cope with. Each developer writes an average of 1 LOC per month. Sure, LOC isn't a good metric, but 1 LOC per month is a symptom of a big problem.

While I was there, I tried to push away tasks that required adding complexity while I focused on improving the rot. This was not welcome, so I quickly found another job and left. Took me a year to go in and out and by the time I left I felt depressed. Spending a whole month trying to understand a problem in order to fix properly and repeating this over and over again is a recipe for burnout.
To this day, I feel developers there are undergoing abuse. Sure, no one is beating them up or forcing them to be there, but this is the only employer in the area and many of them have lives and families there. The only alternative is taking a massive pay cut.

Here is a quick example of how ""bugs"" are ""fixed"" in this company. One day there is a production crash on a nullptr member access:

```
void func(Object* obj)
{
    obj-&gt;method();
}
```
When the crash happens, some junior developer will try to trace down what happened exactly here so that we can fix the problem at the source. Then some ""senior"" developer will push something like

```
void func(Object* obj)
{
    if (obj != nullptr)
        obj-&gt;method();
}
```
and call it a day.

Anyhow, years of this kind of ""fix"" has made it impossible to develop new business, but management keeps pushing new features. 

We have a 3 month notice in this company, so after I gave mine I decided to disobey orders and start doing what I always thought should be done: fixing technical debt.
However unwelcome by management, developers loved it. I split objects logically, structured my little corner of the project and added unit tests (a new concept in this 5M LOC codebase).

MIT/Harvard/Stanford's online DS/algos courses are great for theory and understanding. Real life application and real code matters too though. You learn best when you actually implement these DSA for yourself.

This repository is a collection of DS/algorithms implemented in Typescript. If you also need video lectures, they're there too.

I finished the first section of data structures. sequences.

- static/dynamic arrays
- linked lists
- stacks
- queues
- double-ended queues
- circular buffers

Next week we'll cover the Priority Queue ADT and Heaps.

- binary heaps
- indexed binary heaps
- binomial heaps
- fibonnaci heaps
- pairing heap
- soft heap

The repository and series is just getting started! The plan is to go over all classic data structures. Hashing, self balancing trees, tries, graphs.

And algorithms: sorting, searching, backtracking, dynamic, greedy, graph theory, minimum spanning trees, and more.

,SoftwareEngineering,"For the last couple of months, I'm struggling with some internal questions regarding my coding standards and approach to solving problems. 

A couple of months ago I left my previous job as FullStack+DevOps at a multinational company. I left as I felt there wasn't that much room to grow, and most of the things that I was doing felt like a routine, I didn't feel that I was challenged anymore, this was my first job as a full-time developer, I worked part-time for 5 years.

I got a job at a startup, to see how things work on the other side, as I was expecting the team is really nice and I love the atmosphere at the office, I got the job as it looked interesting and challenging(new architecture, different language: go), all the buzz words that you hear now on what things should look like.

I wrote a couple of cli tools in go a couple of years ago while in uni, so the language isn't new for me and I also have a lot of experience working with static type languages, my colleague(we are 2 working on the backend) on the other hand comes from PHP world, 15+ years of experience.

Ok, so now that I presented the context a bit I will present the problems that I'm really frustrated about.

Exactly after I switched to the startup I missed having access to high-quality peers, which I can do technical sparing with, in my previous job, if I had a problem that nobody from the team had a proper answer, there was someone in the building who had experience with that and they could give some advice.

 How to solve this while working with a small group of people? (I started asking questions on different slack/discord servers &amp; stack exchange)

When I started the code-base was full of copy-pasting, there was no use of interfaces(dependency injection wasn't a thing), the code was full of error swallowing(still is to some extent), composition was used everywhere, close to none use of design patterns(and when it was used half-implemented), global variables everywhere, a lot of the stuff is done in a dynamic way(i guess it's because of PHP mindset), the code wasn't written in an idiomatic way. After I started doing some feature development and seeing the codebase, I talked with my colleague regarding the state of the codebase we both agree that this was a problem and I spent 50%, maybe more, of my time refactoring. 

I started building abstraction over the core functionality that was used across the services, remove redundant/duplicated code, make the pipeline more maintainable(changes are required less often?), define things in a single place. When I started doing the changes I started to use go features, and use the statically typed functionality to get the errors as soon as possible(compile-time when possible), fail if the environment is configured, and so on. This of course broke some things, and I fixed them as they would pup up, we have good code coverage so that helped during refactoring. But things pop up now and then where they were working before and not after my refactor, I always get from the feeling while discussing with my colleague ""why do we do it this way, as the old way was working"", I tried to shift the coding style to something that is more normal for statically typed languages, I also tend to write more defensive code, and I always try to fail as fast as possible, I never got a feeling that this was a welcomed/understood. At my previous job, we had huge technical debt, and debugging was horrible, so I know what is the pitfall of ""just make it work""(or at least I think I do).

A lot of times when I code review or discus about design thing I feel like I am talking as a senior, I tend to do a lot of research before I do things as I don't have as much experience in web development, and sometimes I see what bad decisions were made during development. When doing sparing I can't really talk about patterns or coding principles, a lot of times when I do code review it feels like the code was copy-pasted from stack overflow, it wasn't once when I asked about something and I got the answer ""I got this from a blog post"". There are a couple of things that I can't really spar about as they sound like magic.

The main problem that I get from this is that I don't trust that my mistakes are caught during code review. Since I started here my coding standards have got lower as I got to a point where I say fuck this, I haven't written it not my problem, the sad part is that when I do code review sometimes if it's not a big issue I do the same not to point out all the mistakes.

I am learning new things, as I wanted when I left my previous job, but everything is from research online, there are very few things that I got from the team.

I've never doubted my coding decision before, but I'm starting to do that. It's not like I haven't had bad ideas before, but I always got an explanation of why that is bad while sparing with my team-mates, here I don't really get a clear answer. Both here and at my previous job I got really good feedback regarding my approach and my skills so I don't think I'm imagining these problems.

I want to know if other people experienced something like this and what was the approach taken?

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi,

One of the financial analysts I work with asked what secrets software engineers use for remote collaborative work.  While I run two open source projects on GitHub, FluentMigrator and RazorLight, I don't think those experiences are the best examples to give him.

One thing that does spring to mind is Conway's Law.  Probably the best example I can think of as it applies to Conway's Law is the cultures of Pluralsight and Uber.  Uber built an entire user interface design pattern called the RIB around what it felt would optimize for the best rollout of features in its apps and improve code quality.  Pluralsight based its learning intensive culture around the concept of Mob Programming where five programmers at once huddle around a keyboard, use a massive HDTV sized computer monitor, and think of the best approach to code something.  However, not being in either of these cultures disables me from writing about some of the salient aspects.  I could conjecture how it applies to Conway's Law, but it would seem like a farcical or fake story.

,SoftwareEngineering,"When troubleshooting problems, I always trip up on simple issues in the most obvious places. This is in contrast to more complex, obscure problems where information is limited and spread out - I am able to piece together seemingly unrelated pieces of the puzzle and come up with solutions a lot more effectively.

This could've easily been solved had I followed my logic (e.g. having read the logs I remember thinking explicitly, how can it be possible that we are trying to deploy the same image if I pushed a new commit?) and not made any assumptions about the steps that lead me up to a certain point. I know we should be making as few assumptions as possible, but it's impossible to make no assumptions at all and I when I do make assumptions, they seem to be wrong more often than not.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello!

Just a little background about myself and the company I am working on: I am a Developer on Digital Agency where we primarily build websites using various CMS. We are relatively small, around \~25 people, composed of managers, designers and a handful of developers.

I'd been working for them for &gt;3 years now, it was smooth and I enjoy the work-life balance. I was primarily assigned (or getting my projects and tasks) for/from **project manager ""A""**. I never had an issue working with project manager A. He has some general knowledge on how to use the CMS we use for our products. I am also aware that there are client requests that didn't have to reach me because he can answer or even resolve them by himself. Unfortunately, project manager A has resigned.

That's when things started to become rowdy on my end. I started getting my tasks from **project manager B**. She is non-technical, nor she is even trying to be technical.

* She obviously didn't even try to learn how to use any of the CMS we use for our main product. There are basic tasks she would ask you to do in the middle of the day while you are focused doing on your scheduled tasks. She would also try to squeeze in these basic tasks every time you would be in a meeting with her.
* She would regularly and simply forward the client's email to me and ask me to ""see what's needed to be done"".
* She keeps telling me she has no idea what the client is saying/asking every time a client sends her an email. Why doesn't she just simply discuss the details to the client? instead of putting me in a meeting with her and we start guessing what the client wants? Isn't getting the details from the client is what the project manager do?

I tried to search on the internet if non-technical Project Manager is normal, and I found this article: [https://www.projectmanagement.com/blog-post/21179/Should-a-Project-Manager-have-Technical-Skills-in-the-Area-they-are-Managing-](https://www.projectmanagement.com/blog-post/21179/Should-a-Project-Manager-have-Technical-Skills-in-the-Area-they-are-Managing-)

The article justifies or even promotes that Project Managers should not have the technical skill, which I quote:

&gt;The biggest problem a project manager with a technical skill can have is the inability to let go of their technical background and move onto managing the project. At some point in their careers, to be successful, they must make the decision to become full time project managers and leave behind their technical background. If they don’t they will do neither job well.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not understand how it works. If a Project Manager doesn't have the technical skill, how are they even discussing the project with the client?

I'm not sure if that's how it really is, maybe I just got pampered by the previous project manager because he has some sort of technical background. But I don't see my status improving on as the newly hired project managers don't sound any technical too.

And the approach of our new Digital Director where ""everything is a team, don't leave anyone behind, check with your project manager first before going home"" is giving me more work compared to before where I can simply leave the office after 5 pm because no one is going to message you 5 mins before 5 pm and asks you questions on what to reply to the client.

Is this how your agency/company works too? Any advice? Are my assumptions about Project Managers wrong?

I have an offer from XXXXXXXX in LXXXXXX starting in September this year as an associate application developer (Java) which is good.

They asked me about Agile and version control but nothing to do with Java.

This is concerning as I have just completed a Masters conversion course of software development, hence, no real java skills atm (apart from learning them at University)

The other thing that's putting me off is the fact because this is the XXX (CXXX) the salary is a bit low (as experienced in my case 24K at band 6G level) sidenote: what would be the salary after one year anyone know of that? (6A?) so would it be a good idea to start and build my career there for one or 2 years before going to another company

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi there. So in addition to my day job I do some development for fun at home. What used to be a high end gaming rig has become a server for my whole house. The production copies of the applications I've made get deployed there. It's this deployment model that I want to improve.

Currently, the way it works is this:

1) I build the production artifact of the application
2) I copy it to an artifacts directory on the server.
3) Adjacent to that directory is a docker-compose file. It has ALL of my configurations in it, one giant file.
4) Adjacent to it are my individual docker files, if the deployment needs one. All of the dockerfiles for all my projects are here.
5) I then use docker compose commands to do all build and deploy operations.

Here is why I don't like this:

1) all the manual steps. Copy the artifact, stop the app, build it, redeploy, etc.
2) the centralized deployment configs. All my deployment configs are separate from the app repositories and are in my deployment repo. This just makes it easier to work with docker-compose, I've tried splitting into multiple compose files but it can get weird.

At my day job we use PCF, which has a nice CLI for pushing and deploying to our environments. I've also been interested in learning kubernetes. These solutions may be a bit overkill for what I need, but I'm willing to look at them.

My ultimate goal is to get a solution for deployment that is far more elegant than what I have now (ie, pushing to deploy similar to how PCF works, configs living in individual repos in manifest type files, etc).

,SoftwareEngineering,"At any company, we sometimes need to write ad-hoc scripts to perform data clean-up against a DBMS.

I've been at organizations where typically this can be written and vetted by a DBA and subsequently run by a DBA against production after performing dry runs against hand-generated or scrubbed/anonymized data.

,SoftwareEngineering,"**I run a podcast where I chat with Tesla owners about their life on how they got to the point to afford a Tesla and I wanted to post the transcript of an episode that is not live yet, in which, you could find some guiding advice or at least get to know an interesting story in the IT world.**

**Career of Greg, who runs an IT recruiting agency, defied the odds and made great money to afford a Tesla Model Y.**

**How did your career start out?**

My career started out. I would say post college. So I got a degree in genetic biology from Purdue University in Indiana, and then moved myself paid 2008 I'm going to go do genetic research and just make my name for myself in the industry. 2000 was a bad year. Ended up working in the restaurant industry, kind of living paycheck to paycheck, did that for, six or seven years after college and basically wasted my college degree. Never had more than $10,000 in my bank account at any time. And pretty much would just go to work, make enough cash money and then go out to the bars or hang out with friends and drink and just party for the most part. So some points I'd say in my mid late 20s, about five years ago, so I'm 34, I decided to change my career and move into the it recruiting and staffing industry. And essentially, the last five years, the success and growth in my career from that has kind of progressed and yielded the ability to afford a Tesla.

**Why did you decide to get into recruiting?**

There's no reason in the world anybody would ever get into the recruiting world. And first of all, I knew nothing about it before I did. And if you talk to any of the recruiters for the most part, they don't either and they just kind of stumbled into it. So literally one day, a friend of mine from college was on the same floor as me in our dorm at Purdue sent me a message on Facebook and said, Hey, I know we haven't talked in like 10 years, but if I recall correctly, you're great with people who want to come work for me at my company. And I said, Sure, it's about time to change things up, maybe make some more money. And sure enough, I accepted an offer at it as a technical recruiter and an IT staffing agency. And I didn't even know what I was doing when I accepted it and that's kind of how I ended up in the IT.

**How much time did it take to learn into your job as a recruiter?**

So it was relatively quick. I joined a small company, and that small company, there was no training programme in place or nothing that was very robust. So it's kind of trial by fire sink or swim. I basically figured it out or I was gonna, you know, not make it. And I did. I was very successful very quick. Fortunately, the person that sent me that message got me into it was it was a great mentor. He did help when I needed it. But I'd say the time it took for, you know, stage one. So being successful, there was three to six months, which I think is pretty quick for that industry.

**How did you recruit your first client?**

In recruiting, the learning curve, I think is vast, especially with no training. And I think one of the first positions I worked on in technical recruiting was a Java developer, software engineer. And I came to learn that it's a very sought after skill set very difficult to recruit a full time candidate that doesn't need sponsorship to work in the United States. And I was not prepped for that I had no idea. I put together a statement. And searched I think on monster, and had thousands of results. And I kept looking at all these resumes. I'm like, why are all these resumes, like an Indian name for the first name, and then the last single initial for the last name, and no one cared to share with me a little bit about that there are a lot of these spoof or generic resumes that flood the databases to get to people to call and then there's a whole ecosystem of of candidates that you can recruit from, but they're not the types that I needed. And it took it took me like a week to understand that I was looking at fake resumes. And I was tired of it. I was like, I don't know what the heck I'm doing. I'm never gonna be successful. You know, they gave me the hardest skill set to work on the first time. So after a week, I finally get to the end of about 1000 results. And I say it was the last page of these results, but it probably was. I don't think it really was, was it was a guy by the name John and I won't say last name. And John, I got in touch with them. He was my first placement we got him in. He got hired right away and it was a quick and tough to learn victory for me.

**What do you do now?**

I run a staffing agency.

**How did you become a CEO?**

This started about just under a year ago. So I essentially graduated through the ranks. I started as I mentioned before, as a technical recruiter. So recruiting in the IT field, quickly found success and moved my way up to a Senior Technical recruiter, and then transitioned from, recruiting candidates on one side of the table , to account executive which is just the sales side of recruiting but now you're selling and finding clients for recruiting. So I went from recruiter, senior recruiter to account executive to CEO in five years.

**What is something that you learned in this five years on how can one can get promoted, for example, the fastest way possible?**

One is we are creatures of complacency. And we typically do not want to change our ways of life unless we're forced to. So that means we don't really proactively change things that might be changing unless we're kind of cornered and we have no choice but to you know, people stay in bad relationships. They stay at really bad jobs they live in in specific situations that aren't really conducive to a healthy lifestyle. And we'll stay in those bad scenarios. And typically not make a change unless we're forced to react, meaning you know, it's a life or death situation or you're truly treated like crap at a job and you find the said enough, enough, and then you make that change. If there's anything you could practice, I would be being proactive in the situation. So instead of just accepting things where they aren't being complacent, if you're not happy with your job, if you're not happy with the relationship, or whatever the case may be, make the change proactively instead of waiting for it to force you to make a change.

One other lesson I learned and something that truly got me actually two things that got me to where I am today. Back before I made the change from kind of being I would say, I'll use air quotes here a “loser"" in the restaurant staffing industry, not saying that anybody else in the industry are losers, but I was one word or words of wisdom that really resonated a friend of mine, Dave said to me one day is like, ""Greg, think about the five closest people you surround yourself with, and their attributes and kind of their drives and passions and successes and energy or, or so on. You're a combination of basically those five closest people"" and I kind of laughed at him at the point I said, Okay, whatever. And then I really thought about that. And truly I kind of mimics a lot of the same aspects as everybody around me. And at some point, I made an active effort to change that. And I started surrounding myself with a few other people that were more successful, definitely more passionately driven about the career and that I think it's actually what sent me down the path to change everything in those five years. And the other thing is, if you're contemplating leaving your company, or just contemplating doing a business on your own, 99% of people have these great ideas of how to run a business to start a business and be successful, but nobody ever actually pulles the trigger to do it. And I encourage you, if you think you have a great idea, there's no reason not to just today make that decision to go out and do it. Everybody just has the idea and then never pulls the trigger.

**There are two quotes that comes to my mind. One is from Asia, “The best time to plant a tree was five years ago"", referring to the action that you should have taken five years ago. And the second part of the quote is that ""the second best time is now"" and now. Regarding the five people, there's a quote I found from Jim Rohn that goes “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with”. Was there any ah-ha moment or realisation that helped you in these five years to  pivot and get to the CEO level?**

Yes, absolutely. Tying back in to the concept of that I discussed earlier, of being proactive or being forced to react. And as I mentioned, us as humans, creatures, complacency typically don't make those changes until we're forced into a corner and say, and that's enough. That's actually how I ended up where I was today and more of how I understood why that's important to address. So I was complacent. I definitely only made changes when forced to react, and I didn't really acknowledge it at the time. But fortunately, I was at a company where they're a great company, great management. I'm not belittling them in any way, but I definitely wasn't happy there and I felt like the management was just really restricting my creativity and just made me feel not valued. So it really bothered me. Even though I put up with that for a certain amount of time, there was one day where I live in Chicago and have to take public transportation to work. And occasionally terrible stuff, some people jump in front of trains or get hit by trains, and it will completely cripple your commute to work and basically makes it impossible for some people to get to work. So that happened one day unfortunate. And my boss called me or actually, I finally got into the office, and I got yelled at and ridiculed because I was late, and I tried to explain the circumstances. And it was ""I was just like, you know what, that's enough. I'm not working here anymore"". And I quit. And then that transitioned me to my next career phase. And at that point, I made that I had that realisation that I only reacted and made a change later than I should have, when I could have proactively taken approach to change earlier.

**Can you share a funny resume or CV that came across your desk?**

I could think of 1000 examples. Once, a relative sent me his resume and reached out because he knew that I do staffing and recruiting and I have a lot of experience with resume writing. And his parents suggested, he graduated from or actually didn't even go to college. His parents suggested get a job get out of the house. You're an adult, you know, move on. So he's thinking himself well, how do I create a resume? Let's reach out to Greg. So the resume he sent me. Oh gosh, it was the worst thing I've ever seen in my entire life. It it basically said one of the passions, were watching baseball. I'm like, you don't need to put that on a resume. And the formatting was wrong, the grammar was a mess. Everything you could think of you don't want to do in a resume, was on there. And I looked at that, and I just laughed. And then, I spent about an hour on it. Recrafted it and he got a job right after that.

**It's a quite tricky for someone who has never been active in the job market to create or update their CV. Can you give some brief pointers for someone who is just looking to land a job in IT?**

Yeah, absolutely. And that's actually something I host webinars and volunteer to do in a lot of different organisations. Giving those tips and helping people I would say I call it search engine optimise the resume. A lot of people don't realise that on my side of the table as a recruiter, when I was a recruiter, or even just recruiters, generally, companies, they don't realise what goes into finding you as a, you know, candidate. And so the main thing is understanding the optimization of your resume for search algorithms. And essentially, if you want two tips, one tip is truly think of the buzzwords that are appealing to your industry. For example, if you're a software engineer, and you work with Angular react and the front end for frameworks, those are very appealing to a lot of clients right now. So if you have any remote experiences that you don't have on your resume, it is essential to add it to your LinkedIn profile and to your resume wherever it's posted. So that when recruiters are searching and finding you and they're using that search parameter, Angular, you're going to pop up in the results. So make sure you're including all those really attractive buzzwords for your industry. Tip two would be definitely, you know, make the resume look relatively aesthetically pleasing to the eye. A lot of people I hate to say this do juxtapose a lot of different job descriptions, and so on, by copy pasting from other people's profiles. If you're going to do that, and there's nothing wrong with it, as long as it accurately depicts what you're doing, please take the time to make sure that the font size and everything are the same, because otherwise we looked at data like oh, gosh, this guy didn't take the time to change it.

**If you had to start your career again, let's say after university with the goal to afford a Tesla, what would you do?**

If I could have all the knowledge that I've gained at this point in my life at 34 years of age, and could I go back and graduate college and do things differently, it would ultimately be, to truly apply yourself in an area that you think you have a passion and learn the ins and outs of that. And then pursue and educate and just refine those skills. And then more importantly, understand that you don't have to work for the you know, the man or work for another company to be successful. It would be take all the skills that you've acquired over those couple of years of learning a new industry post-college, and then be creative and be an entrepreneur and turn that into your own company. Anybody can do it, and most people are terrified of doing it, but the reality to start a new company with the skills that you have, it's very simple. And people kind of stop themselves with the starting line just because they think there's a lot that goes into it, but it's not. So I would take all the stuff that I had from 14 years or so, since college, go back graduate college, and I would join a company that I think I'd be, you know, that I thought I had a passion in. It probably wouldn't have been the staffing industry because I knew nothing about it. I would soak up all the skills and information that your mentors, your boss, the company, the industry, your clients, we all give you. Take all that in and then become an expert of all facets of it. And then once I have all the information instead of working for somebody that tells you what to do and makes you feel like you realise that they're making more money than you because of your work. Then I would take the information leave, start my own company and be the top guy in the food chain.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Career of Greg, who runs an IT recruiting agency, defied the odds and made great money to afford a Tesla Model Y.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did your career start out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My career started out. I would say post college. So I got a degree in genetic biology from Purdue University in Indiana, and then moved myself paid 2008 I&amp;#39;m going to go do genetic research and just make my name for myself in the industry. 2000 was a bad year. Ended up working in the restaurant industry, kind of living paycheck to paycheck, did that for, six or seven years after college and basically wasted my college degree. Never had more than $10,000 in my bank account at any time. And pretty much would just go to work, make enough cash money and then go out to the bars or hang out with friends and drink and just party for the most part. So some points I&amp;#39;d say in my mid late 20s, about five years ago, so I&amp;#39;m 34, I decided to change my career and move into the it recruiting and staffing industry. And essentially, the last five years, the success and growth in my career from that has kind of progressed and yielded the ability to afford a Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you decide to get into recruiting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no reason in the world anybody would ever get into the recruiting world. And first of all, I knew nothing about it before I did. And if you talk to any of the recruiters for the most part, they don&amp;#39;t either and they just kind of stumbled into it. So literally one day, a friend of mine from college was on the same floor as me in our dorm at Purdue sent me a message on Facebook and said, Hey, I know we haven&amp;#39;t talked in like 10 years, but if I recall correctly, you&amp;#39;re great with people who want to come work for me at my company. And I said, Sure, it&amp;#39;s about time to change things up, maybe make some more money. And sure enough, I accepted an offer at it as a technical recruiter and an IT staffing agency. And I didn&amp;#39;t even know what I was doing when I accepted it and that&amp;#39;s kind of how I ended up in the IT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much time did it take to learn into your job as a recruiter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was relatively quick. I joined a small company, and that small company, there was no training programme in place or nothing that was very robust. So it&amp;#39;s kind of trial by fire sink or swim. I basically figured it out or I was gonna, you know, not make it. And I did. I was very successful very quick. Fortunately, the person that sent me that message got me into it was it was a great mentor. He did help when I needed it. But I&amp;#39;d say the time it took for, you know, stage one. So being successful, there was three to six months, which I think is pretty quick for that industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you recruit your first client?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recruiting, the learning curve, I think is vast, especially with no training. And I think one of the first positions I worked on in technical recruiting was a Java developer, software engineer. And I came to learn that it&amp;#39;s a very sought after skill set very difficult to recruit a full time candidate that doesn&amp;#39;t need sponsorship to work in the United States. And I was not prepped for that I had no idea. I put together a statement. And searched I think on monster, and had thousands of results. And I kept looking at all these resumes. I&amp;#39;m like, why are all these resumes, like an Indian name for the first name, and then the last single initial for the last name, and no one cared to share with me a little bit about that there are a lot of these spoof or generic resumes that flood the databases to get to people to call and then there&amp;#39;s a whole ecosystem of of candidates that you can recruit from, but they&amp;#39;re not the types that I needed. And it took it took me like a week to understand that I was looking at fake resumes. And I was tired of it. I was like, I don&amp;#39;t know what the heck I&amp;#39;m doing. I&amp;#39;m never gonna be successful. You know, they gave me the hardest skill set to work on the first time. So after a week, I finally get to the end of about 1000 results. And I say it was the last page of these results, but it probably was. I don&amp;#39;t think it really was, was it was a guy by the name John and I won&amp;#39;t say last name. And John, I got in touch with them. He was my first placement we got him in. He got hired right away and it was a quick and tough to learn victory for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you do now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run a staffing agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you become a CEO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This started about just under a year ago. So I essentially graduated through the ranks. I started as I mentioned before, as a technical recruiter. So recruiting in the IT field, quickly found success and moved my way up to a Senior Technical recruiter, and then transitioned from, recruiting candidates on one side of the table , to account executive which is just the sales side of recruiting but now you&amp;#39;re selling and finding clients for recruiting. So I went from recruiter, senior recruiter to account executive to CEO in five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is something that you learned in this five years on how can one can get promoted, for example, the fastest way possible?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is we are creatures of complacency. And we typically do not want to change our ways of life unless we&amp;#39;re forced to. So that means we don&amp;#39;t really proactively change things that might be changing unless we&amp;#39;re kind of cornered and we have no choice but to you know, people stay in bad relationships. They stay at really bad jobs they live in in specific situations that aren&amp;#39;t really conducive to a healthy lifestyle. And we&amp;#39;ll stay in those bad scenarios. And typically not make a change unless we&amp;#39;re forced to react, meaning you know, it&amp;#39;s a life or death situation or you&amp;#39;re truly treated like crap at a job and you find the said enough, enough, and then you make that change. If there&amp;#39;s anything you could practice, I would be being proactive in the situation. So instead of just accepting things where they aren&amp;#39;t being complacent, if you&amp;#39;re not happy with your job, if you&amp;#39;re not happy with the relationship, or whatever the case may be, make the change proactively instead of waiting for it to force you to make a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other lesson I learned and something that truly got me actually two things that got me to where I am today. Back before I made the change from kind of being I would say, I&amp;#39;ll use air quotes here a “loser&amp;quot; in the restaurant staffing industry, not saying that anybody else in the industry are losers, but I was one word or words of wisdom that really resonated a friend of mine, Dave said to me one day is like, &amp;quot;Greg, think about the five closest people you surround yourself with, and their attributes and kind of their drives and passions and successes and energy or, or so on. You&amp;#39;re a combination of basically those five closest people&amp;quot; and I kind of laughed at him at the point I said, Okay, whatever. And then I really thought about that. And truly I kind of mimics a lot of the same aspects as everybody around me. And at some point, I made an active effort to change that. And I started surrounding myself with a few other people that were more successful, definitely more passionately driven about the career and that I think it&amp;#39;s actually what sent me down the path to change everything in those five years. And the other thing is, if you&amp;#39;re contemplating leaving your company, or just contemplating doing a business on your own, 99% of people have these great ideas of how to run a business to start a business and be successful, but nobody ever actually pulles the trigger to do it. And I encourage you, if you think you have a great idea, there&amp;#39;s no reason not to just today make that decision to go out and do it. Everybody just has the idea and then never pulls the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are two quotes that comes to my mind. One is from Asia, “The best time to plant a tree was five years ago&amp;quot;, referring to the action that you should have taken five years ago. And the second part of the quote is that &amp;quot;the second best time is now&amp;quot; and now. Regarding the five people, there&amp;#39;s a quote I found from Jim Rohn that goes “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with”. Was there any ah-ha moment or realisation that helped you in these five years to  pivot and get to the CEO level?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, absolutely. Tying back in to the concept of that I discussed earlier, of being proactive or being forced to react. And as I mentioned, us as humans, creatures, complacency typically don&amp;#39;t make those changes until we&amp;#39;re forced into a corner and say, and that&amp;#39;s enough. That&amp;#39;s actually how I ended up where I was today and more of how I understood why that&amp;#39;s important to address. So I was complacent. I definitely only made changes when forced to react, and I didn&amp;#39;t really acknowledge it at the time. But fortunately, I was at a company where they&amp;#39;re a great company, great management. I&amp;#39;m not belittling them in any way, but I definitely wasn&amp;#39;t happy there and I felt like the management was just really restricting my creativity and just made me feel not valued. So it really bothered me. Even though I put up with that for a certain amount of time, there was one day where I live in Chicago and have to take public transportation to work. And occasionally terrible stuff, some people jump in front of trains or get hit by trains, and it will completely cripple your commute to work and basically makes it impossible for some people to get to work. So that happened one day unfortunate. And my boss called me or actually, I finally got into the office, and I got yelled at and ridiculed because I was late, and I tried to explain the circumstances. And it was &amp;quot;I was just like, you know what, that&amp;#39;s enough. I&amp;#39;m not working here anymore&amp;quot;. And I quit. And then that transitioned me to my next career phase. And at that point, I made that I had that realisation that I only reacted and made a change later than I should have, when I could have proactively taken approach to change earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

It it basically said one of the passions, were watching baseball. I&amp;#39;m like, you don&amp;#39;t need to put that on a resume. And the formatting was wrong, the grammar was a mess. Everything you could think of you don&amp;#39;t want to do in a resume, was on there. And I looked at that, and I just laughed. And then, I spent about an hour on it.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hey all,

I'm 23, a software engineer in Dublin, Ireland. I've been with the company for roughly 9 months now and I'm just curious regarding a few things.

This is my first career job straight after college. I've been given a probation of 6 months but due to my 'unprofessional' ways, it got extended to 9 not 6 months.

This is my last month of probation, I've weekly sync ups with my manager because I've been threading thin ice for some while (poor performance due to me sleeping in all the time, especially with the whole work from home thing).

I understand many of you will say that I should stay for at least 18 months and make sure I've made a sizable contribution before I leave, but it just feels like the reason why I'm sleeping in all the time is because I'm not motivated (not enjoying) by what I do.

Have any of you went through a similar phase to shed some light on this situation?

2. Supports ExpressJS/ReactJS. The app has a server written with ExpressJS and a client in ReactJS.
3. Works with docker. I've got everything dockerized, so that's easy enough. Alternatively, if they have their own container solution that's easy enough to work with, that would be cool too.
4. Supports MongoDB. It uses Mongo as a data source. I have a local dockerized mongo, I could do the same thing on the host, but I'm assuming in this case they would offer a data source.

&lt;li&gt;Supports ExpressJS/ReactJS. The app has a server written with ExpressJS and a client in ReactJS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works with docker. I&amp;#39;ve got everything dockerized, so that&amp;#39;s easy enough. Alternatively, if they have their own container solution that&amp;#39;s easy enough to work with, that would be cool too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports MongoDB. It uses Mongo as a data source. I have a local dockerized mongo, I could do the same thing on the host, but I&amp;#39;m assuming in this case they would offer a data source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi, I have been working on a product for a few years that I plan to set free by making it open source. To help make the best decisions possible, I have a few questions that I wanted to bounce off the community here. Thank you in advance for your input!

**- Security**: How do you think about the relationship between security and open source? Under what conditions do you think that an open source software platform dealing with Authentication/Authorization/IAM/SSO can be more secure than one that is closed source and why? (if you need more context, please assume this product is similar in scope to Auth0)

**- Licensing:** Would you be more, less, or just as likely to use an open source product that is Apache 2.0 vs AGPLv3 licensed and why?

**- Community Edition &amp; Enterprise Edition:** If a software product has core functionality defined as ""Community Edition"" under either Apache 2.0 or AGPLv3 license and enterprise add-ons defined as a paid ""Enterprise Edition"" under a custom license (e.g. how Gitlab does it - [https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/LICENSE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/LICENSE)), would this influence whether you would use the Community Edition if you found that edition useful?

Would love suggestions on what categories, tech stacks, workflows you guys run into issues with where such an actionable way to collaborate would work best. I am trying to figure out if people would use this or not. If you guys want an invite to be an expert or to use it, ping me! Thanks so much!

The key here is instancy - you are coding and you run into a build error or an integration bug or you need help deploying/writing a Dockerfile. Imagine within 2-3 minutes you get connected to an expert who can help you fix the bug or write that file. So instead of submitting a question on StackOverflow or on a forum, you just submit a request and get the issue resolved via live help.&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi there!

For almost two years I've been working in a small company (less than 15). Our development team consists of only two people (including me) while in the past it consisted of 4/5 people.

Previously to this job I worked at a start-up where I did learn a lot (Vue, .NET WebAPI 2, MVC) but had to switch jobs because the payment was very low / working very hard.

From my colleague it came to my knowledge that apparently we are almost as productive / doing the same lifting of work as the previous team. This translates into having to deal with a lot of responsibilities and sometimes a lot of pressure because they expect us to work hard (since we have shown we can be very productive).

To be honest the payment is average / slight above average but it feels like I'm becoming an all-rounder. I have to work with ASP webforms, WCF webservices, SharePoint, doing IT admin tasks, answering phone calls with customers in case of bugs and maintaining a monolithic code base.

It feels like my previous skills are rotting away and now 'learning' technologies that could be build more efficiently and be better maintainable (and enjoyable).

Sad part is they expect you being a full-stack developer + SharePoint developer + IT admin + customer service. My goal was to specialise in new and enjoyable web frameworks (re-active) + specialise in REST back-ends / .Net core.

I hear a lot that it's better to specialise in something than to know something about a lot of stuff.

I have tried to make my point clear and they have allowed me to make a basic WebAPI setup and transfer little parts of our software to MVC. Though most of the time we are busy with maintaining the old legacy code base.

And furthermore we have to work on machines that are 10 years old (Core 2 duo) which in itself is sometimes frustrating because the machines are too old / slow to have a decent working experience.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi everyone, I'm pretty sure this is the right place to post this, but forgive me if not.

***TL;DR -*** I have not found a lot of information out there regarding MBT and am led to believe it is little more than an academic pipe dream; am I right in saying this?

For context, I'm doing doing my master's thesis on performance testing and Agile software development. The goal of my research is to find tools and techniques to make performance testing more palatable to your everyday Agile practitioner.

As part of this project, I just wrapped up a systematic literature review related to performance testing and came across a lot of papers saying MBT solves a bunch of NFR testing issues like time, load, complexity, yadda yadda. Before doing this SLR I only had peripheral knowledge of MBT, as in, I knew it existed and had a semi-firm grasp on the concept, but I never implemented it at work or in any project I've been on.

I started to get suspicious because the literature wants to imply MBT-type approaches to performance testing offer better coverage, less complexity, and less cost than traditional performance testing (i.e., load testing, JMeter scripts, etc.). So I figured my next paper would be comparing MBT efficacy against ""traditional"" testing methods and reporting the results; because I'm fairly certain MBT isn't the savior the current literature hints at.

Like I said, I didn't know much about MBT, and because most the stuff I read about it recently was related to performance testing, I figured that's what it's for. But a cursory google search reveals almost all academic sources, no ""here's how to do model-based performance testing on your projects"" types of guides, which makes me think it doesn't yet exist outside of research publications.

So I googled MBT without the performance connotation and did a little better, but it still seems like the concept isn't quite as fleshed out for actual use, or it's just not a very popular approach. Some of my top results from queries like ""model based testing in \[programming language\]"" revealed things like Git repositories that haven't been updated in almost a decade, or applications that have very sparse documentation.

One promising piece of software is GraphWalker, and there's some interesting stuff about it out there. But having *one* promising piece of software for an entire testing paradigm leads me to think that either **a**: I am misunderstanding what MBT is and am actually already doing it everyday, **b**: my googling skills are rusty, or **c**: MBT just isn't all it's cracked up to be.

So finally, my question is, does model based testing exist outside of academia? Have you seen it used in a professional setting (like in business, not research)? Am I misunderstanding what MBT is?",t2_42tyvo8,False,,0,False,Is Model-Based Testing Actually a Thing?,[],r/SoftwareEngineering,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_gocqha,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1590151287.0,text,6,,,text,self.SoftwareEngineering,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure this is the right place to post this, but forgive me if not.&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"I am looking into creating a software tool that will utilise machine learning algorithms to find patterns within successful Amazon listings in order to generate suggestions to the user (an Amazon seller) on how to modify/ optimise their own listing.

&amp;#x200B;

As a student of computer engineering this is going to be a final year project, I am relatively sufficient in Java (degree level so beginner in the grand scheme of things), and will have a mentor/project coordinator to guide me. I am very new to anything that is not Java and this project is designed to be challenging,  it has also been agreed with the coordinator that a commercially viable software tool is good to do.

&amp;#x200B;

As a beginner I am aware that to get data from Amazon there are 3 APIs available, and there is also the option to scrape data, which apparently requires IP rotation as Amazon does not like it (and may be a route my coordinator does not allow). I am hoping that someone could provide some general advice on a couple of areas.

  
1)What data can I get from using an Amazon API? Where can I find some beginner friendly resources on this?

&amp;#x200B;

2) How valid is my statement about Amazon not liking software scraping from their site? Are there any ways to do this that are deemed acceptable? I am just getting the data that can be read off the screen by anyone - just on a large scale.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Is there any scope for a beginner to consider making their own API if the APIs provided by Amazon do not give the information I need? I want all the text off the listing, this is bullet points, main listing body, reviews, title.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Can any more general advice be given to help a beginner on their way? Any other methods on how to achieve the goal? I have my meeting with the coordinator in 6 days really trying to nail down a good project idea.

&lt;p&gt;As a student of computer engineering this is going to be a final year project, I am relatively sufficient in Java (degree level so beginner in the grand scheme of things), and will have a mentor/project coordinator to guide me. I am very new to anything that is not Java and this project is designed to be challenging,  it has also been agreed with the coordinator that a commercially viable software tool is good to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a beginner I am aware that to get data from Amazon there are 3 APIs available, and there is also the option to scrape data, which apparently requires IP rotation as Amazon does not like it (and may be a route my coordinator does not allow). I am hoping that someone could provide some general advice on a couple of areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)What data can I get from using an Amazon API? Where can I find some beginner friendly resources on this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) How valid is my statement about Amazon not liking software scraping from their site? Are there any ways to do this that are deemed acceptable? I am just getting the data that can be read off the screen by anyone - just on a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Is there any scope for a beginner to consider making their own API if the APIs provided by Amazon do not give the information I need? I want all the text off the listing, this is bullet points, main listing body, reviews, title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Can any more general advice be given to help a beginner on their way? Any other methods on how to achieve the goal? I have my meeting with the coordinator in 6 days really trying to nail down a good project idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apologies in advance if this is not the correct community for this post, I am new to Reddit so still learning the decorum.&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"Good afternoon,

I had a few questions that i could not find the right sub for. I am currently an Architect and while in school we did a lot of python, C++ coding with kuka robots. Not many know but there is a hard cap on earnings as an architect, unless you make your own firm which requires a lot of capital. Currently I manage about 20 people + outside consultants on the team. 

Therefore while researching software engineering etc... My goal is to be a tech lead (not sure if that the correct term).   


I am currently in California, so my question is. Could i just get a bachelors in computer science, and work a bit before i land that tech job, or is it recommended to have a masters at least.  

&amp;#x200B;

My current plan is to go to Community college and get the bare minimum to transfer into a CS at state college. So i can work and pay out of pocket for the school.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi guys,

Just wondering if someone could give me advice on becoming a software engineer. I’m a petroleum engineer by degree, but I really hate this industry. I got pushed into the oil industry by my family and I’ve tried really hard to like it and stay in it, but I’m burnt out and I need out. 

I’m really interested in learning coding languages and I’m in the process of teaching myself python too. I think being a software engineer would be cool, but I don’t know what all I need to land an entry level job, well at this point an internship I suppose. Also if someone could maybe give me some insight into different aspects of software engineering that would be great.

I’d prefer not to go back to school, as I would have to take out loans and it would be a huge financial burden. I also just think college is an overhyped waste of money (for pe’s it is). I will most likely be laid off soon in this downturn so it’d be an even larger financial burden without a job.

Also, maybe some female software engineers can give me some insight into how it is being a female in the industry. The oil industry is definitely a “good ole boy” industry which makes it very difficult for women to advance in technical roles (they mainly switch to sales, admin, hr, etc.) and I’d prefer to stay in technical roles.

Over the past two and a half months, I've tried three different things, and they're not working. I'm not allowed to take marketing surveys, I'm not good at stock photography, nor am I good at blogging; I have yet to establish another income stream. Besides, I don't think these help with my career development overall, as I need to learn a lot more engineering practices and tools for programming.

* How would I be able to tackle orders that are fraud or illegal?

* Will I get a chance to learn some handy tools I can use?
* How would I be able to cope with order cancellations where I have to pay back?
* What can I do to attract some customers who want to place an order? For instance, what ads should I look at to find a rough estimate on the price of the order?
* Did any of you folks did this before? If yes, how was, or is it?
* What do you think of some platforms that let you establish freelance work? One example is Fiverr from Israel.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi everyone,

Original thread has gotten pretty popular over at https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/glz7rn/aws_tutorials_by_an_exaws_engineer_interested/ so thought I'd share here too.

I worked at AWS as a software engineer for a few years. I've noticed some interesting things since leaving:

* People who want to deploy websites/apps/pages are really, really daunted by AWS.
* Trying to find AWS tutorials online is just awful. It feels like everything is either a manual, a ""12 hour certification course"" or an outdated Medium article from 2016. 
* Many people are using Netlify, which is really just a wrapper around AWS, and similar ""instantly deploy services"".

I've recently helped some friends in the startup world set things up on AWS - mostly deploying static sites. So far, all of them are now 

* spending less money on hosting
* getting better load time on their sites
* deploying things pretty much as quickly as Netlify's offering

I'm planning to write up some friendly resources/tutorials on using AWS so others can have these benefits too.

Would you guys be interested in this? 

If so, **please let me know what kind of tutorial you'd like to see.** It'll help me decide on the best tutorials to start with. For example, it could be ""deploying a static site on S3 + CloudFront"".

**It would also be a huge help if you could answer in this form I setup earlier: https://forms.gle/SFTuigCBeupeReV2A.**

**In addition to helping me decide which content is best to start with, it'll give me a way to distribute tutorials I create to you guys.**

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hey everyone, I'm just looking for some general advice for my situation.

I graduated from college recently and I've been struggling to find a software engineering job in my area, and the pandemic is making this harder. After the pandemic, a recession will probably happen, so should I go back to school and get a Master's in Software Engineering given the situation? 

I recently moved back to my hometown due to a death in my family and I want to stay in my hometown for the foreseeable future. I have very few connections in the area for networking and I wouldn't classify the city I live in as a tech city, but there are definitely jobs and industries in the area.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and I've come to realize that I'm far more interested in creating and designing software much more than most theoretical topics in Computer Science, so I don't think pursuing a Master's in Computer Science is right for me.  I have some experience working for smaller companies as a software engineer, but no more than two years of experience.

Given my circumstance, would going back to school locally for software engineering help me make more connections in the area I'm in and boost my chances of getting a job? Is it more valuable to go back to school to get a Master's rather than job hunting during/directly after the pandemic?  

Also, I understand that having a degree in Computer Science and some work experience qualifies me for at least a few software engineering jobs, but I'm ultimately wondering if the additional schooling is worth my time and money for making connections, boosting my skillset and expertise, and having more on my resume during an employment gap, especially given the job market and the state of the economy.

Alternatively, instead of going back to school, I was considering just working on projects for a professional portfolio and applying for jobs in my area as they become available again. I'd like to network too, but I can't do that in person at the moment due to the whole pandemic.

I'm trying to weigh my options and see what the best choice is; any advice is appreciated.",t2_5p5eeyt9,False,,0,False,Should I pursue a Master's in Software Engineering?,[],r/SoftwareEngineering,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_gmjpll,False,dark,0.76,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1589901082.0,text,6,,,text,self.SoftwareEngineering,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, I&amp;#39;m just looking for some general advice for my situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

We already have so many tutorials and courses on how to program Java, but I decided to write a Medium story that touches on the basics of Java programming with actual code. This is for people who want to get their hands on code right away before reading the tutorials.  I also have a full program at the end with lots of comments.

I hope this is a big improvement over the other Medium story I sent before about two weeks ago. I'm pretty sure I missed a lot out of Java itself, but that will have to be discussed in another story.

,SoftwareEngineering,"I am working on a web application as a hobby and trying to learn some concepts related to cloud development and distributed applications. I am currently targeting an AWS EC2 instance as a deployment environment, and while I don't currently have plans to deploy the same instance of my API application to many servers, I would like to design my application so that is possible in the future.

I have a search operation that I currently have implemented using a Trie. I am thinking that it would be slow to rebuild the trie every time I need to perform the search operation, so I would like to keep it in memory and insert into it as the search domain grows. I know that if I only wanted to have one server, I could just implement the trie structure as a singleton and dependency inject it. If I do this in a potentially distributed application, though, I would be opening myself up to data consistency issues.

My thought was to implement the trie in another service and deploy it separately and make requests to it (this sounds like micro service concepts, but I have no experience with those). Is this common practice? Is there a better solution for maintaining persistent data structures in this way?

Any advice would be appreciated. I am a recent college graduate and the company I work at uses only one sever for all their deployed monolithic applications, so I am hoping to learn as much as I can about this on my own time

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi,

I'm a junior software dev and all my experience has been at medium-large firms, where the majority of changes that take place are  relatively low-key to already up and running apps.

I've got a friend at a very small start up, which isn't really a software company as such but is starting to build out its codebase in MATLAB and has begun using Git. My friend asked me how they can avoid coming across 100s of merge conflicts when they're all working on the same bits of code, which is likely since they don't have a lot.

I also have the luxury of a suite of unit tests and a build server that'll tell me if I've broken something somewhere else which he doesn't have.

,SoftwareEngineering," 

Hi all

so i am totally new to this (30yo). very excited to making a change of career in this direction. my brother gifted me a ruby course on Udemy, just started.

so i am a bit of a lazy person. struggle with the discipline of putting in the legwork of making my dreams and plans a reality. I will plan to, perhaps put in 8 hours of Udemy course per week and only do 1.

I have recently been chatting with a friend from a self-development program i participate in (landmark) and he has suggested something that has worked for him well around issues like this:

he suggested committing to a date for landing a job in the field. then putting in some milestone goals along the way, all with specific dates. I would like to give this approach a go.

my current plan was to finish the Udemy course on Ruby, embark on a few projects that have application in real world with user interaction/feedback, learn pieces of additional languages required for those projects, start applying for jobs.

if you feel this would be a suitable approach, how many hours do you think it would take to achieve this?

there are a fair few posts our there about how long it takes to get a job from scratch. It seems to vary a lot depending on how much time put into learning. It would be nice if i had a rough estimate of how many hours it will take to get to point of realistically applying for job, so i can pick an end date, work backwards to see how many hours per week i will need to put in etc.

thanks for any advice

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I am tasked with recognizing the silhouettes of moving cars and the exact position (+- 10cm) of their tires. I can install at least 1 camera at the side of the entrance where cars will be moving through with a distance of ca. 2m from the cars. 

The installation would be in front of a car wash in order to control the hardware doing the cleaning to be fitting for the car measures. This also means that cars won't be moving more than 10km/h when driving through the entrance.

&amp;#x200B;

How would you build a system that does the recognition of car silhouettes and tires that accurate?

\- Would you use depth field cameras? That could probably make recognizing the silhouette fairly simpler than with a normal camera. But how to recognize the tires then?

\- Would you use Neural Networks?

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi guys,

Copy-paste is an important part of life for all the students and developers out there :p

There are multiple scenarios where we copy over the same thing over and again (example commands).  I really liked Windows 10's Clipboard History (Win+C shortcut) where it saves most recent clips which you have copied.

After shifting to Mac and Linux, I constantly felt the need for such feature/application. So I made one in electron so that I can use it on any operating systems.  Install the application on your OS, start copying. Most recent 20 clips will be shown in ***System Tray*** or Press shortcut ***Ctrl+L***(For Win and Linux) ***Cmd+L***(For Mac) to open a window, where you can navigate through your copied clips using mouse or up/down keyboard arrow keys.

Select the clip which you want by pressing enter or mouse click.  Necessity made me built this :-)

I was looking at transferring to a more traditional software role but I have some concerns.    


1. My current skills may not transfer well and while I had the skills in college I will need to do a deep refresh to be competent. 
2. From a friend in the industry, it seems that a lot of software engineering is constantly working as a team effort and pairing up to write even simple code.

I absolutely do not want to snub anyone who arrived in that way, but for me personally, I have more confidence in my own ability to learn independently than to spend 50k-100k on an education .

2. What resources are available online to begin?

I’m new to programming, but have basic knowledge of html, CSS, python, and Javascript. I’m looking to expand on that with this project, but also am open to other tools.

A bit more info:
- One database is an accounting program, and the other is time card data. The accounting program had everything but realtime timecard data.
- The default reports that are built in to both programs aren’t that good, but I’m also looking at this as an opportunity to expand my portfolio as a developer.
- The data for the dashboard would come from many different tables within each database.
- I’d like to build a real time dashboard for project managers. This would have stuff like number of leads, dollars estimated, quotes sent, costs vs. budgets of current projects, etc. Maybe some pie and bar charts.
- A nice bonus would be the ability to “drill in” to reports for more information. For example if you wanted to know how the “number of leads” metric was generated, you could double click on it and it would show you the list of jobs included in the count.
- The ability to print the dashboard and generate PDFs of it would be a nice touch.
- Only LAN access would be necessary; remotely accessing the data would be too tricky.

I supposed because of what we do, that makes sense: incomplete systems aren't too useful. However I figured there would be some jobs that mostly focus on bug fixing or upkeep or porting or something (I have seen such positions exists for full time). I would be fine with that if it meant I could be part time and ideally remote.

,SoftwareEngineering,"We all know that you need to invest your time and money in something that could help you live more stable in troubled times. 

As a software engineer, you have a lot of ways how to do the investment. For instance, create some site and publish tutorials there and enabling the ads.

,SoftwareEngineering,"[Not sure if this is the right sub to post this]

TLDR; I am considering a career change from product management to software engineering. Has anyone done this, or switched from a marketing or tech lead role back to engineer? How did it go? 

I’ve worked on the “business” or customer side of technology for a bit over 10 years.

I tinkered with HTML and JS a bit in my teens and after doing other stuff for a few years I was lucky enough to land a business analyst gig. 

It allowed me to get close to software development projects early in my career which really piqued my interest. 

So I went back to uni and studied software engineering and marketing while I worked. 

Since then I’ve worked as a “Technical” Product Manager in varying forms (Internal Systems, API’s, SaaS and consumer facing) for some pretty big websites (30k average DAU).

The thing I love about product is being able to identify problems or opportunities and formulate ideas on how to solve for them. 

I’ve always continued to do some coding. Either on the side (python mostly) or as part of some prototyping or demo stuff at work. Partly to keep my mind fresh but mostly because I enjoy making stuff work. 

The kinds of products I work on are data-focused and relatively interesting in both system design, data flow and scale (concurrent users etc.). 

That’s the kind of software engineering I am interested in as well. 

I am keenly aware that tinkering with things isn’t the same as doing it as a job (And I really don’t want this to come across as some snotty PM undervaluing devs - I refuse to work anywhere engineers aren’t seen as my peers).

But, I am confident I would be able to learn enough of the latest .net or python data processing standards within a couple of months to be able to ship some features. 

The best engineers I have worked with are bordering on being product managers anyway. They care immensely for the customer and value simplicity over complexity every time. 

What I don’t enjoy about PM is the ego and politics that is inherent at certain levels, the perception of value we add to an organisation when really we could just use a metric value to decide whether or not pursue an opportunity and just how little time I have to _think_! 

I just want to work with a team, learn, solve problems and avoid the stress that comes with the above. 

So, has anyone done this or something similar? If you were in a position where you could make this shift, knowing some engineering leaders who would give you a crack at an entry level gig - would you do it? 

Thanks for reading and I look forward to your replies.

,SoftwareEngineering," Hey guys, 

we are a group of business administration and engineering students from the university of Ghent tasked with creating a hypothetical enterprise. Our idea is to develop a mobile app that makes paying by way of a bank terminal easier and safer for people with visual impairment. The app would work as follows: when the user presses his/her phone against the terminal, the amount due would be transferred through NFC to the user's phone. This amount would then be read (through headphones) to the user via Text-to-Speech. After the user confirms the amount, the app would redirect to the user's preferred banking app and the purchase would be complete.

As we do not possess enough knowledge about app development to assess if this would be possible (let alone implement this ourselves), we chose to outsource this. Given the current crisis however, few companies have time to help out students right now. Which we completely understand.

So our question is: would something like this be possible? And if yes, what would be a good estimate for the cost of development?

,SoftwareEngineering,"My main question is: should I stay in SENG or switch into comp sci?

Right now, I'm heading into 2nd year of SENG so I have another 3 years of school until I will graduate. Since I have 2 years of credits in BSc and 1 year of credits in SENG, lots of those would transfer into comp sci and if I take a couple classes online during the summers I would be able to get my bachelor's in comp sci in 2 years. 

What I'm really wondering is if it's worth the extra year of school to get the SENG degree or if most jobs would only require a comp sci degree. From what I'm told, the two degrees differ with SENG's working more in team management while people in comp sci do more software development and tech support type jobs. I guess what I want to know is does getting a SENG degree set you apart from comp scientists? Is there better jobs that it can get you? Or for the majority of people are the jobs the same regardless of which degree you have?

&amp;#x200B;

I am the sole developer, infra, and ops guy on an on-prem platform (atleast 16 services for a 2 node configuration), I asked the project manager for me to be shifted to this last year (specifically, October, documented through emails, chats and calls on teams)  


&amp;#x200B;

I lay out the required effort on tasks for the project manager, like a spreadsheet with columns for tasks, effort (in man days) and status (whether, started, reworked, stopped, etc) and commitID/Issue# so they can be aware of what I am doing at any given time.  


&amp;#x200B;

Now, before I was even assigned for this project, they've committed to the client to deliver this in 1 month. They just told me now. The presentation I made October last year suggests that this project could take atleast 4 months due to rework on APIs and well me being the only one working on it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, PM wants me to construct a timeline, because she ""will never fall for that MAN DAYS thing again..."", but I politely declined to commit when (I might get fired but not sure if they can rework the committed date, as I've said I am the only one who knows this app back and forth, it atleast needs 3 people to replace me. I sound like a douche but I am confident that they won't be able to find anyone with my skillset in 6 months).

&amp;#x200B;

They keep telling me, ""we will need to focus on this part first"", where we == me. Which I also politely declined because it wont add any benefit (just getting me doing busy work). Backstory is: there were performance issues on the previous version of the app which made the app unusable, and in my opinion changing one component is not going to guarantee that it will be fixed.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi there, 

I'm wanting to know what skills I should request a software dev have to be able to have the best possible chance of building out the system I'm looking for. 

The goal of the system that we're wanting to build is to have a camera watch a ship and calculate the stress/strain on wires as the elements they attach to (mast/boom etc) are moving. 

For example, a sail ship has a number of guy-wires attaching to the mast/boom and other areas. As the boom moves from side to side, the guy-wires will have different stress/strains placed upon them. A specific boom position means that specific guy-wires will have certain amounts of stress/strain on them. So essentially, we need the lengths and Young's modulus' of the guy-wires, booms, mast and other objects on the ship pre-programmed in and have the stress/strain of these objects calculated in real-time during the dynamic movement of the ship. 

Two questions arise: 

i) What skill sets would the programmer need to have in order to be able to build out such a system? I'm guessing potentially mechanical engineering mixed with software and potentially even an animator? But also, what languages? 

This would need to be packaged into software that can run on a smart phone/tablet for real-time use, ii) what programs would such software need to be originally written in?",t2_5pdj75o1,False,,0,False,What skills should I ask a software dev to have in order to be able to build a system that requires stress/strain calculations on a ship's supporting structures performed on a smart device in real-time?,[],r/SoftwareEngineering,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_g6uuh6,False,dark,0.67,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1587704466.0,text,6,,,text,self.SoftwareEngineering,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there, &lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"I am looking to build a video chatroom app where users can create / join private chat rooms, and I would appreciate some advice on how to go about storing the chat data. Whenever a new user joins the room, they should receive a history of all the previous chat messages, as well as the list of current users.

On average, I expect chat rooms to be destroyed (ie. everyone has left the room) within a few hours of their creation. Thus, most of the data that needs to be stored is very temporary. On the other hand, messages in the chat will probably be somewhat frequent, and the data will be updated often. What would be a good approach to storing this data?

I've considered a few possibilities:

* Since the room will support video calling in addition to textual chat, I considered implementing the textual part of the chat with the WebRTC data channels, since the clients will already need to create WebRTC connections for video. Then I would only need a server for signaling (it would still need to store the list of rooms and users in each room), and the message history could simply be stored at every peer? When a new user joins the room, they could just get the message history from one of the peers. But in this case, I wonder if it's possible to end up in a scenario where (due to disconnects, etc.) no single peer has the full message history?
* Storing the the data in some in-memory data structure on the server side. Or perhaps using some in-memory database such as Redis?
